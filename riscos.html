      <h1>ROUGOL Meeting on Monday 19th Jan 2026</h1>

(date: 2026-01-14)
      <p>
      <p>SUBJECT: Multi headed systems</p>
<p>This month Chris Hall will be Zooming in to show off his multiple heads. He has been experimenting with an R-Comp Hydra system, with two heads running RISC OS and a third with Linux.</p>
<p>He will be describing how well the new Hydra works, why he wanted multiple heads, how each head is configured, and how the system as a whole performs in use. He will expand on his article in the latest Archive, with a digression about RDP versus VNC for connecting between heads.</p>
<p>There should be time to look at some of his software – such as RingBind, Cat, DrawDis and Locking, all of which make use of MakeDraw. He will demonstrate how to make subtle changes to Draw files that aren’t possible in Draw, by disassembling them using MultiTask and recreating them using MakeDraw after some subtle edits.</p>
<p>@Bryan your email at helpful demon co uk is not responding. Is Thur evening OK for a practice run please.</p>

      <h1>Updating Submenu Dialogue Boxes</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>I have a feeling that I might be missing something obvious here…</p>
<p>I have a dialogue box as a submenu (a program information window), which has a toggle size icon so that the user can expand it to read additional details about the application. This works fine.</p>
<p>However, it would be nice if it could always open in the small state, to be a little bit tidier. With a normal window, this would just be a case of fiddling with the visible extent before calling Wimp_OpenWindow, but as a submenu, I can’t see how to do it.</p>
<p>I can set the submenu warning flag and catch Message_SubmenuWarning, but as far as I know that gives me the window handle and not the Open Window block. Similarly, Wimp_CreateSubmenu doesn’t take anything but the handle, so I can’t mess with the visible area before creating the dialogue on screen.</p>
<p>Sitting on Open Window events for the dialogue suggests that the application doesn’t receive one until the window is moved, not when it initially opens – so that doesn’t appear to help either.</p>
<p>Is there any way to achieve what I’m trying to do? Or is it a case of “I wouldn’t start from here”, and I need another approach to displaying the additional info (or just live with the toggled state persisting between visits)?</p>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>There’s another test release of the Clarity desktop theme <a href="https://lym.iconbar.com/downloads/clarity5.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>This release includes iconsprites for the ROM apps, as well as sprites for their iconised files. It also includes iconsprites for most of the !Boot apps, such as !System, etc. It adds some pointer sprites missed from the last release, and makes some minor edits to some existing sprites. The next release will cover Configure. Any feedback welcome – this is still very much in development.</p>

      <h1>Paint sprite dragging</h1>

(date: 2026-01-13)
      <p>
      <p>Just discovered something in Paint 2.59, RO5.31, 14 Dec 2025. If I open a sprite file window, then try to drag one of the sprites to another window, I get an error saying <code>SpriteExtend: Sprite Doesn't Exist</code>, and Paint quits. If I click menu over the sprite, and use the Save dialogue, then the drag works fine. This is odd, as I’ve been using Paint very extensively over the last few weeks, also the latest version I think, and I haven’t come across this before. Can anyone else see this?</p>

      <h1>&#39;Mailbox is full&#39; phishing puzzle</h1>

(date: 2026-01-12)
      <p>
      <p>I received an email yesterday saying:</p>
<p>==&gt;</p>
<p>This message was created automatically by mail delivery software.</p>
<p>A message that you sent could not be delivered to one or more of its</p>
<p>recipients. This is a permanent error. The following address(es) failed:</p>
<p><a href="mailto:info@theworkshopseries.co.uk">info@theworkshopseries.co.uk</a> LMTP error after RCPT TO:&lt; <a href="mailto:info@theworkshopseries.co.uk">info@theworkshopseries.co.uk</a> &gt;:

<p>&lt;==</p>
<p>It is lying, because my message did get through to the intended recipient, who said that his mailbox</p>
<p>was certainly not full. Now I have heard of these ‘Mailbox full’ phishing scams. But the links in this</p>
<p>message appear to be harmless. I presume that the scam’s method relies on inserting malware into a</p>
<p>computer to take note of the sender-addresses of emails arriving in the inbox. I had used Plusnet’s</p>
<p>webmail to send my original email, using the Chrome browser, so I do not think there is any malware</p>
<p>inserted at my end. So no harm done. But is my diagnosis correct? Should I be warning</p>
<p><a href="mailto:info@theworkshopseries.co.uk">info@theworkshopseries.co.uk</a> that his computer may have been compromised?</p>

      <p>Thanks to @armbytes.bsky.social for reminding me of the RO2-era BBC Basic “LOCAL DATA” foul-up. I’d dealt with it in nemoBasic by allowing READ as a synonym for DATA after LOCAL/RESTORE, which avoids the ancient tokenisation problem (duplicated in editors like Zap of course).</p>
<p>But I fixed it.</p>

      <h1>DHCPv6</h1>

(date: 2026-01-11)
      <p>
      <p>I’m in the very early stages of writing a DHCPv6 app to work with the ROD IP stack. I’ve got as far as getting two IPv6 addresses assigned by the router to me (one global, one local), but I can’t see how to add them to my machine. All my experiments so far with the “route” command have failed, mostly complaining of a bad address. (I’ve only tried adding the local address so far.)</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to issue a command to add an IPv6 address to RISC OS?</p>

      <h1>Sponsorship for 64-bit work</h1>

(date: 2026-01-09)
      <p>
      <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>There’s been a little bit of discussion about how people who are not technical can contribute towards work. One of the ways that has been suggested has been to provide donations towards people or that work. To try to provide a mechanism for this, I’ve decided to use the GitHub Sponsorship button.</p>
<p>On many of my GitHub projects, including the general `riscos64-status` project ( <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status</a>), there is a Sponsor button. This will take you to <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/gerph/">https://github.com/sponsors/gerph/</a> where you can provide a sponsorship.</p>
<p>Providing sponsorship will encourage more development and tools for this project.</p>
<p>If you feel that the things that I’m doing and the work towards RISC OS 64 is valuable, please feel free to sponsor me!</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>In case it matters, StrongED on the working machine is 4.68f12, while on the newer one it is 4.70a15, Has printing changed there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, do you mean 4.68f2 (last version of 4.68) or 4.69f12?</p>
<p>I’ve compared the printing code in 4.69f14 vs 4.70a20 and there aren’t that many differences. There’s some changes to how headers and footers are handled, and changes to make the print dbox override of the mode font height/width work.</p>
<p>If you’re using headers/footers then try turning them off and see if that helps.</p>
<p>ISTR an earlier report of PS3 issues but I can’t find that right now. Anyway, try printing with the PS2 driver, if possible. That will show if there is an issue with PS3 or if it’s a more generic problem.</p>

      <h1>Iyonix and the rest of my Risc OS collection</h1>

(date: 2026-01-08)
      <p>
      <p>Firstly, don’t tick “act as IP router”. If you fill in anything in the Routing window, only put the address of your router – leave everything else blank. If using DHCP, leave everything blank/unticked.</p>
<p>For IP address, either use DHCP (no options) or static (fixed) IP address within same range as router (eg. 192.168.8.100). Netmask of 255.255.255.0 Note that not many routers use 192.168.8.x so you might want to confirm that. 192.168.1.x or 192.168.0.x are more common.</p>
<p>For Host names, put hostname (eg. iyonix) in first box.</p>
<p>If using DHCP leave rest unticked/blank.</p>
<p>If not using DHCP, put something in domain (must have a dot in it) such as .nom or .home or a full domain if you have one (eg. riscos.com). For primary DNS, put address of router. For secondary address put 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare) or 8.8.8.8 (Google).</p>
<p>Set/Save etc. Don’t forget to reboot.</p>
<p>If this doesn’t work, be aware that one of the first signs of a failing Iyonix PSU is the network port failing. USB ethernet is possible on RISC OS – stick to USB 2 adapters though, ideally with ASIX AX88772 chipset. Not every ROM has EtherUSB in ROM though.</p>
<p>RISC OS cannot use USB soundcards at all without a custom ROM. Even then, it can’t use it system-wide, only via specific software.</p>
<p>Finally, be aware that Iyonixes are amongst the more troublesome machines to keep going (see Martin Eastwood’s problems). You may be better off with a cheap Raspberry Pi to play around with – it will likely give you better compatibility with old games etc via !ADFFS and the AnyMode module.</p>

      <p>No spoilers, but as someone who adored Stranger Things all the way through, I found the finale very satisfying. Great piece of television, one of the best series Netflix has ever put out.</p>

      <p>The opportunity has once again come around for people involved or interested in software development on, for, or even of RISC OS to gather together and discuss matters relevant to the topic. The next friendly fireside chat is scheduled to take place on Saturday, 10th January. The meetings – which are held online, using the Zoom video conferencing system – don’t follow a set agenda.

      <h1>Pre-order Voices From A Future Passed</h1>

(date: 2026-01-07)
      <p>
      <p>For those who enjoyed <a href="https://rougol.jellybaby.net/meetings/2025/dec.html">Rob Napier’s talk at ROUGOL</a> last month, and those who missed it but were also excited to read the full history of Acorn, here’s a message from Rob about progress on publication of his book:</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the holiday break, VOICESFROM A FUTUREPASSED has moved toward publication.</p>
<p>I am cautiously confident that it will be released on 1 March online through Amazon and through some bookshops and possibly some museum shops.</p>
<p>I have set up an information site at <a href="https://www.doitonce.net.au/">www.doitonce.net.au</a> . It gives an outline of the book and a campaign to donate part of the sale price to museums. Please visit the site for details.</p>
<p>If you would like to pre-order or to contact me, just send me a message from there. I try to respond to everyone within one business day.</p>
<p>My HTML skills are a bit rusty and I’ve not managed to get too excited about current web design trends. If anyone has any comments/feedback, I’d be happy to receive your advice. That said: Please be gentle.</p>
<p>All the best</p>

      <p>The screenshot of your desktop Marin looks certainly different from the norm. I must admit I do like the experientation people go into customzing their desktops. Just to ask about the frosted theme, what version or release it is currently on just now? Also is there a direct link to the source of your themes to keep tabs of your latest updated themes?

      <p>I see OpenAI are now &quot;betting big&quot; on audio. Once again a tech company is claiming voice-to-text will replace the keyboard. It won't. It's for bigshot CEO types dictating their bullshit into the ether. Voice-to-text is, and will forever remain, a frustrating medium for any kind of detail work.</p>

      <h1>App locations inside !Boot</h1>

(date: 2026-01-06)
      <p>
      <p>I’m beginning to delve into the murky innards of !Boot, with a view to extending the Clarity theme to the various default apps within it, including Configure. Presently, the sprites in the Clarity theme are installed with a simple Boot merge, with the new files all added into <code>!Boot.Resources.!ThemeDefs.Themes.Clarity</code>. This ensures that the sprites used by the Wimp, plus the icons used for the ROM Apps, are replaced.</p>
<p>If I also want to replace the icons used for the various !Boot apps (!Scrap, !System, etc), then I’m assuming that I can use the same Boot merge to add the required sprites into their various application directories (ie, <code>!Boot.Resources.!System.Themes.Clarity</code>, etc). This does assume that those application directories never move around – is that something I can rely on?</p>
<p>Similarly, the icons for the Configure app aren’t all in the same place. On RO5.31, most are in <code>!Boot.RO500Hook.Res.Configure</code>, but the Internet configuration seems to live in <code>!Boot.Resources.Configure</code>. Again, can I rely on these locations staying consistent, and use a Boot merge to add new sprites into their respective app directories?</p>
<p>I’m aware that there are theme manager applications in development, such as ExtTheme, that will probably be able to handle all this with a bit more aplomb, but I’m hoping to keep the basic distribution of Clarity as simple as possible – just an iconset that can be copied over !Boot with the various components dropped into the right places.</p>

      <h1>Celebrate ten years of the Titanium with WROCC – 7th January</h1>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>Back in October 2015, there was a surprise announcement something visitors to that year’s London Show could expect to see – a new motherboard, designed by Rob Sprowson, with RISC OS in mind; the Titanium. The board itself became available through Rob’s company Elesar Ltd in December of that year, allowing people to build DIY machines around it, and it wasn’t long before there were complete Titanium-based computer systems available from both R-Comp and CJE Micro’s. That was a touch over a decade ago, and Rob Sprowson will be taking…</p>

      <h1>Live Coding with Gerph, Sunday 4th January at 1pm UK time.</h1>

(date: 2026-01-04)
      <p>
      <p>A bit of a scattered day today. I had fixed PicoC so that it could handle the _IN() and _OUT() macros, but somehow broke _OUTR() so the testing got a little distracted. However, the SWIs all seem to work on RISC OS 64, and so I moved on to replacing the data blob for the CPU registers descriptions with one that can be generated. We now have some Python code that builds the data that these tables use, which will make it a lot easier when we need to replace them with a different platform (or update them!).</p>
<p>Hopefully that was interesting to people. I also showed off the hotkey lookup in the editor as well – pressing shift-ctrl-h opens a Chrome Window with the relevant RISC OS documentation in. Pretty simple to do with all the other work that’s gone before, but I finally got around to doing it.</p>
<hr>
<p>With that, I think I’m done on what I want to do on the Kernel Introspection for now – it’s stubbed well enough. I think next week, I think I’m going to have a look at FSCommands, unless anyone wants to jump in and ask for one of the other components…</p>
<p>Most of Phase 1 is complete ( <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Phase-1">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Phase-1</a>) but Phase 2 has lots of things in it ( <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Phase-2">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Phase-2</a>).</p>

      <p>More great work from Mark Moxon. This time it's BBC Micro Sentinel that has been disassembled, annotated and made into buildable source code. Deep dives coming soon too. Looking forward to reading through all this. Geoff Crammond's code has been thoroughly dissected after almost 40 years!</p>

      <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>Just a little note to say that the PicoC tool that I’ve been using for some of the verification of 32-bit and 64-bit components has been released. PicoC is an interpreted C, which you can use at the command line or with files. It’s handy for writing small things in which just exercise a few SWI calls.</p>
<p>It is even passing its almost all the original tests that were supplied with it (those not run are largely for time).</p>

      <h1>New DME ExtTheme and Launchpad available for download and testing</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Thanks Chris, hope you’ll like your old protocol still living, breathing and growing, now The Little Yellow Moon original protocol also works for themes from boot :)</p>
<p>Meanwhile:</p>
<p>Big thanks to Martin for testing new themes creation and also running this on his own systems.</p>
<p>I have pushed a new build that implements it’s own file copying in C, because calling RISC OS `*Copy` via OS_CLI in a Task Window from an Application doesn’t seems to be very reliable on RO 5.31 if themes are a bit big (on the multiple megabytes size). Anyway the new in-app copy implementation is a lot more reliable, hence installing zipped themes from a TaskWindow should be fine now.</p>
<p>Also, I pushed a new build of the dark theme, because the previous one was missing the font. (Yes ExtTheme can install Theme’s fonts too).</p>
<p>Note: !PackMan replace the app when updating, so, my DME will create a backup copy of your old one in `Boot:Resources.DME_Backups`, so if you feel like your installed themes have disapeared after an update you can find them in the safety backup and/or you can simply install them again via `*theme install …`.</p>
<p>A note for Andrew/ROD, it seems that Iris had some issues downloading zip files (the themes), the same zips download fine with NetSurf. I am still figuring what’s going on with Iris, so consider this an heads up only for now (and if you are around and reading this).</p>

      <h1>Using EX0 and EY0 for higher definition</h1>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <blockquote>
<p>There are a quite a few things that don’t take into account the screen scaling when using EX0 EY0. The mouse pointer is one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The OS <em>does</em> scale the mouse pointer for the eigen factors, witness changing to a EX1 EY2 mode. The issue is that a number of APIs assume no more than 32×32 hardware cursor (probably arising from VIDC, but I think some other graphics controllers have that limit too) so for example when you try to scale ptr_default which is 22 pixels high at EX1 EY1 you’d get 44 pixels at EX0 EY0 and the bottom 12 pixels are cropped off. The hourglass with percentage is taller still.</p>
<p>So your options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live with the cropped pointer. Result: at least it’s proportionally the right size compared with everything else</li>
<li>Fudge it by using the 12×22 pixel pointer sprite in the Wimp’s Sprites11 file, this is what Castle opted to do with the Iyonix and that’s spread to some of the other themes. Result: at least it’s not cropped, just a bit teeny tiny</li>
<li>Roll up your sleeves and ripple <a href="/wiki/documentation/show/Proposed%20GraphicsV%20enhancements#TOC3.3">the planned API changes</a> through all the bits of low level graphics drivers which assume 32×32. Result: not cropped and correctly scaled on hardware that can do bigger overlays</li>
</ul>

(date: 2026-01-02)
      <p>
      <p>Kevin Wells has released another new version of FlagQuiz, his application that allows users to test their knowledge and recognition of national flags. Version 1.02 addresses a fairly basic issue in the program, whereby the sprites file containing the various flags used by the program were loaded into the WIMP sprite pool. Unless a program specifically needs its sprites held there, this is bad practice because it risks an application’s sprites being used in place of ones used by the system. Kevin has therefore updated FlagQuiz to store its sprites…</p>

<p>It relies on parts of the C library, which makes it problematic. StubsG is available as a binary and works – it should be usable as-is. Is there a particular issue you have found with the library?</p>

<p>The C library’s Apache licensed, so as long as you’re willing to make your code have a compatible licence it should be fine.</p>
<p>If it’s of interest, I have a (macOS/Linux) Makefile that fetches the source for stubs and builds three variants – 26bit, 32bit and vfp. The latter is a 32-bit stubs, patched automatically. It uses a python (extended) implementation of decaof to rename certain symbols in the symbol table in the .o files, and includes in the library veneers. These veneers export the original function name, and call the renamed functions. And they’re all made into a library with a python reimplementation of libfile. It sounds like it works very similarly to StubsG?</p>

      <p>Amazingly, BBC Basic never really had a limit on the number of dimensions an array can have. The 8bit Beeb could have had up to 126, though the line length limit restricted you to 116. Dimensions were 16b which was more than enough in less than 64KB...</p>

      <p>Happy New Year! 🎉 🥂
I’ve released a new theme manager for #RISC_OS (DME ExtTheme) and a beta update for LaunchPad, the application launcher.
Early beta testing is open now.

      <p>Hi Matthew, happy new year!</p>
<p>That sounds annoying. Please do</p>
<pre><code>*Set Debugger$AnnotatedFile $.excdump
*Set Debugger$DumpOptions -file annotated
</code></pre>
<p>and then after the crash you should find an excdump file which tells you which function 5b18 actually is in your USBDriver plus a backtrace. You could either post it here or attach it to a bug report in the bugs section of this website.</p>

      <p>I modified QEMU to load the “bios” (RISC OS ROM image) at 0 instead of 0×8000/0×80000. So it behaves like kernel_old=1 in config.txt (iirc).</p>
<pre><code>#define FIRMWARE_ADDR_2 0 // 0x8000 /* Pi 2 loads kernel.img here by default */
#define FIRMWARE_ADDR_3 0 // 0x80000 /* Pi 3 loads kernel.img here by default */
</code></pre>
<p>Plus a bunch of excessive logging, but that’s another matter.</p>
<p>If I were them, I’d have gone for a <code>-preload file,address</code> option, myself, to cover all eventualities like bios, kernel, inird, etc..</p>
<p>Just out of interest, do you do anything with ATAGs? I leave a gap, they’ll be readable, but I don’t scan them yet.</p>

      <p>A lot of new nemoBasic syntax is about avoiding repetitive boilerplate. For example, you can tell it to ignore file handle zero by preceding the #  with IF – e.g. PRINTIF#handle.</p>
<p>As nemoBasic allows statements to span multiple lines, this is more involved than you’d think:</p>

There are an awful lot of &quot;bring the reactor back online&quot; style missions, along with a greater emphasis on fighting armed troopers compared with Doom/Doom 2.</p>

      <p>Apparently Jared Leto is going to play Skeletor in a live-action Masters of the Universe movie. I'm not as negative about him as some (more indifferent tbh) but I do feel Mark Hamill ought to have got the gig after his incredible voice acting in the semi-recent Netflix 'Revelation' animated series.</p>

      <p>I finally got around to fixing a bug in RISC OS Basic that is actually from BBC Micro Basic in 1982 – neither tokenises “FORx=1E1TO2E2” correctly!</p>
<p>The reason is some there’s-only-16KB-so-that’ll-have-to-do code which was dutifully carried over to the actually-there’s-more-than-that-now ARM version.</p>

      <h1>Is the system heap meant to be writable from BASIC?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-27)
      <p>
      <p>I was just thinking about somewhere safe for privileged code to write to for user mode code to read from and thought perhaps the system heap, since that’s where I thought the system variables are stored (and R3 returned from <code>OS_ReadVarVal</code> points to).</p>
<p>So I tried:</p>
<p><code>SYS&quot;XOS_ReadVarVal&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, 0, -1, 0, 0 TO ,,,V%</code></p>
<p>V% is set to &amp;303FF7CC, in the system heap, not RMA (&amp;20000000) and printing the string there shows “7backup<span class="math inline">\(Dir”, as expected. What I wasn’t expecting was `V%?5=42` to work, let alone change the name of the variable to “7back\*p\)</span>Dir”!</p>
<p>Is this a limitation of recent MMUs?</p>

      <p>Thank you, removing the Gateway setting got rid of that message. As to those suggesting that I set the IP address manually, that is not an option as I am setting up the machine for use in an environment where I do not control the network, so DHCP is the best solution unless I talk <strong>really</strong> nicely to the network administrator.</p>

<p>ON ERROR is a class of declaration I was hoping to significantly expand before Christmas, but the special surprise I have is still defrosting with the turkey, but in anticipation of that mystery meat I have implemented this:</p>

      <h1>Happy Christmas and New Year from all at R-Comp and ROD</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Firstly, I’d like to wish everyone a Happy Christmas and a super, RISC OS-filled 2026. Thankyou to eveyone for being part of the community this year, and for all your RISC OS related activity, support, developments, purchases and forum posts etc.</p>
<p>I’m now finishing for Christmas (well, it is nearly 4pm on Christmas Eve). The intention is to take a bit of a longer Christmas break as I’m absolutely exhausted from a non-stop year. I’ve been working weekends since the summer, and still not found time to celebrate my birthday from back in October! We’ve more-or-less cleared the decks in time for Christmas, so the plan is to take a rest until early Jan.</p>
<p>My intention is to return to work properly on Jan 12th, although I may well be checking email from the 7th onwards – if you can avoid sending tech support emails until then, it’d be appreciated.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Plingstore will continue to operate, although please be patient as I’ll likely only be approving orders every few days.</p>
<p>Christmas cards – I’m afraid we simply haven’t had a chance to do the usual Christmas Card send-out this year, so if you were expecting one and haven’t received, please don’t take it personally. Hopefully normal service will be resumed next year. I may try and slip a few out whilst listening to “Carols from Kings” this afternoon, but it is a wee bit late now.</p>
<p>Warrington Show (RISC OS North) is on Saturday, March 21st, 2026 – see <a href="http://www.riscosnorth.uk">www.riscosnorth.uk</a> for more info. We’ve been slow on getting exhibitor invites out this year, but please pencil this date into your diary (the show has been paid for, so it is definitely happening). We hope to see you there if possible :)</p>
<p>I hope you all have a really nice Chirstmas period, and have exactly the balance of fun, friendship, food, relaxation and RISC OS that you wish for :)</p>
<p>Best wishes to everyone,</p>
<p>Andrew &amp; all @ R-Comp and RISC OS Developments</p>

      <h1>Disabling scroll wheel on mouse</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>Is it possible to configure RISC OS somehow so that the scrolling aspect of the mouse is ignored across the whole operating system, but clicking the scroll wheel still works as the Menu button?</p>
<p>I tried configuring the scroll speed to the slowest setting hoping that would disable it, but it just scrolls very slowly.</p>

      <h1>BASIC and LOCAL DATA</h1>

(date: 2025-12-24)
      <p>
      <p>In PDP11 BASIC it took just one extra instruction to fix LOCALDATA:continue tokenising:</p>
<pre><code>jsr  pc,TokenSearch	; Search token table
;...
bit  #2,r2		; Are we at the start of statement?
bne  TokenWord1		; No, enter token/char
bit  #16,r1		; Is this a pseudo-variable?
beq  TokenWord2		; No, enter unchanged
add  #&amp;40,r0		; Convert token to command token
.TokenWord1
bic  #&amp;40,r2		; *EXTRA* Middle of statement, don't turn tokeniser off
.TokenWord2
mov  r1,r2		; Copy new flags to current flags
;...
</code></pre>
<p>It looks to me that the ARM code would be similarly simple to update. I’ll have a look at it over Christmas.</p>

      <h1>GCCSDK Built with Nix!</h1>

(date: 2025-12-23)
      <p>
      <p>I’m pretty sure that I am the only person using GCCSDK via nix, but I’ve got some updates!</p>
<p>Firstly, I’m using it to compile for RiscOS from an Apple Silicon Mac! It will also definitely work on windows using WSL! So if you are using any of those platforms, great news! This will work a charm!</p>
<p>Next, I’ve managed to create an initial cross stdenv which means that it is much easier to use nix as the build system. The example flake is here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/yobson/riscos-nix/tree/main/example">https://github.com/yobson/riscos-nix/tree/main/example</a></p>
<p>Next steps will be building OSLib and others this way and move some things over from the auto builder. I also spotted the nordsoft compiler on GitHub (I don’t think it’s the one ROOL uses but will work for risc os), so I may give that the same treatment.</p>
<p>Either way, this is turning out to be a very nice way to bring building for risc os to 2025.</p>

<p>Being able to just GET without storing the result is surprisingly useful (and optimises something I’d already implemented – the statement form EVAL GET which evaluates its expression but ignores the result)</p>

      <p>I read the Jeffrey interview. It is a really nice piece, and a big thanks to him for the shout-out to the RISC OS Community on GitHub! :)</p>
<p>Also, a huge thanks to Jeffrey for mentioning the importance of introducing test automation if people are serious about porting RISC OS to 64-bit systems. Let’s hope his words will be heard. ;)</p>

      <h1>FlagQuiz updated to version 1.01</h1>

(date: 2025-12-21)
      <p>
      <p>Kevin Wells has released an update to his new FlagQuiz application, a piece of software that you can use to test your knowledge of flags from around the world. The program works by displaying a randomly selected flag, along with four options of which nation it might belong to. You then make your choice of one of those four, and you’ll be told if you got it right or not. Unfortunately, there was a silly bug in the original release, whereby it was possible for the four options to not…</p>

(date: 2025-12-19)

      <p>Just to say thank you, Coming from using a Raspi Pi 4 using Risc OS on a SD card. I have received my Chimera box and RISC OS is certainly blazing fast and zippy on a NVME drive. Apps like Netsurf just browse pages like a snap of the finger and playing Doom is very buttery smooth. :-D, Merry Christmas.</p>

      <h1>CRamFS</h1>

(date: 2025-12-19)
      <p>
      <p>I finally got around to trying this out on the RiscPC (using a StrongARM and RISC OS 5.30), and have got some initial numbers from m1time:</p>
<p>RamFS 2.33 (23 Nov 2020):</p>
<p>Save 1M * 1000: 8539 csec</p>
<p>Load 1M * 1000: 6131 csec</p>
<p>CRamFS + memmove:</p>
<p>Save 1M * 1000: 9370 csec</p>
<p>Load 1M * 1000: 7028 csec</p>
<p>CRamFS + BlockMove:</p>
<p>Save 1M * 1000: 9517 csec</p>
<p>Load 1M * 1000: 6346 csec</p>
<p>I’ve added a bunch of comments on the merge request of things that might help, but I currently don’t have any tools for getting more detailed benchmarks on the RiscPC. That said, it should be possible to get the performance roughly equivalent in C – the BlockMove function seems to be the only part that’s doing something complicated that would require assembly code for performance.</p>

      <p>Isn't it remarkable how people with frontend dev skills think AI-generated code needs careful checking, re-checking and multiple iterations of fixes to get it right, but that it does a perfect job of the backend, first time. And vice versa.</p>

      <h1>VNC-linke software or screen recorder for RISC OS</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Here is another way. Run VNCServ on RISC OS. On Mac or Windows or Linux connect to RISC OS via RealVNC client. Start Zoom. Share RISC OS session and switch on Zoom record.</p>
<p>Most of the MUG YouTube videos were made this way.</p>

      <h1>Obscure wimp sprites</h1>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Some more thoughts on Paint, having been using it very heavily over the past few weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The various bugs that used to affect various tools in the Sprite window seem to have been very effectively squashed. I don’t think I’ve had a single crash from that source over many hours of use.</li>
<li>The new outline font tool is great, as is the much better Paintbrush interface. Very nice work.</li>
<li>There’s a bug report (ticket 520) open on the file dragging/selection in the Spritefile window. This issue would be great to look at – it’s pretty annoying to drag a sprite into a file window and have it replace whatever is currently selected, even if the sprites have different names. When dragging dozens of files around, it’s very easy to overwrite stuff by mistake this way.</li>
<li>Relatedly, if you try to rename a sprite in a Spritefile window to one that already exists, Paint silently fails to rename it, rather than telling you why.</li>
<li>The only crashes I’ve had came when deleting a sprite from a Spritefile window. Annoyingly, I can’t reproduce this reliably. If I can find some way to reproduce this, I’ll file a ticket.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not sure if the Bounty work is still current. If it is, then taking a look at some of these issues in the Spritefile window would be really useful. I think possible fixes here would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mimic the Filer’s selection behaviour, so that selecting sprites in one Spritefile window clears the previous selection in another window</li>
<li>Alternatively (or in addition), don’t overwrite selected sprites with different names when dragging sprite(s) into a Spritefile window, but just add the new sprites to the Spritefile</li>
<li>When a sprite or selection of sprites is dragged to a Spritefile window containing a sprite(s) with the same name, or the user tries to rename a sprite with a name already existing in the file, query the decision. Either halt it, or offer to skip/abort/overwrite.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, congrats to Andy for all his hard work – the app has been really transformed.</p>

(date: 2025-12-16)
      <p>
      <p>Following the recent DDE update to DDE32b this issue is fixed in the IOMDROM of 14-Dec-25.</p>
<p>From the changelogs :-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fix for loads of halfword values not making use of unaligned LDR instructions when they are permitted by -memaccess +L41. This resulted in the halfword being formulated from two LDRB instructions which the register allocator did not expect, and R12 being wrongly reused in some small leaf functions.</p>

      <h1>Accessing ROOL Via Three Broadband</h1>

(date: 2025-12-15)
      <p>
      <blockquote>
<p>You’re most likely on IPv4?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very definitely on both IPv6 and IPv4. I was surprised when I tried a Three SIM and found it gave me an IPv6 address (not to be confused with what WiFi gives me!). The IPv6 support is the primary reason I moved (just a few days ago) from O2 to Three.</p>
<p>The killer test, which I’ve just repeated, is to access one of my IPv6-only sites from my phone after turning WiFi off. The web page and the site’s log both show the Three IPv6 address of my phone, which has a very different prefix from that given to me by WiFi.</p>

      <p>Yes, times posted on this site are invariably using UK local time. I’ll include that note in the future, but you can always find out the timezone relative time by going to the YouTube link which should be accurate (unless I schedule stupidly). All my sessions have always been at 1pm UK time.</p>
<hr>
<p>The session yesterday went quite well, despite feeling a little unwell through it. Implementation of the stubbed functions is progressing well. OS_Byte calls are stubbed, although I went back and forth on their naming, as they seem to be given different names in different places. OS_ReadSysInfo has about a third of the calls stubbed as well. We’re only getting a skeleton right now, so it’s not especially complicated.</p>
<p>Tests have been ported from RISC OS Pyromaniac and look ok – they will need to change as we update the implementation.</p>
<p>Next week I’ll look at the OS_Platform calls and probably the memory calls as well.</p>

<p>1. Open GPEDIT.MSC</p>
<p>2. Expand Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Remote Desktop Services &gt; Remote Desktop Session Host &gt; Security</p>
<p>3. Change “Set client connection encryption level” to “LOW”</p>
<p>4. Change &quot;Require use of specific security layer for remote (RDP) connections to “RDP”</p>
<p>5. Change &quot;Require user authentication for remote connections by using Network Level Authtication to “DISABLED”</p>
<p>6. Reboot the PC</p>
<p>Obviously lowering the security defaults for Remote Desktop is a bad idea security wise, so use at your own risk!</p>

<p>The Wimp Templates subcomponent was worked on as part of the Live Coding and is now complete – See <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-wimp-templates">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-wimp-templates</a> for the details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The `riscos64-status` repository has been updated with a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>`PicoC` is noted as a ported language.</li>
<li>`Lua` is noted as a ported language.</li>
<li>`TCC` is noted as a ported implementation of a C compiler.</li>
<li>`GCC` was removed from the ported implementations (it’s not ported, but is usable to build for RISC OS 64, and had been misplaced).</li>
<li>`Pascal` is noted as a ported language (using the P2C tool).</li>
<li>`Rust` is noted as having been prototyped for use with RISC OS 64.</li>
<li>All the feature documents for component now include completion percentages on their pages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The `Kernel: Modules` subcomponent had been started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The `EvaluateExpression` module has been stubbed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The `IIC` module has been stubbed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The `OSSWIs` module has been stubbed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hourglass maker has been ported to RISC OS 64. See <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-hourglass-maker">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-hourglass-maker</a> for details.</p>
<ul>
<li>The module can be found in the `riscos64-status` repository as with many others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Pascal-to-C implementation is being worked into the build environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I presented the general status of RISC OS 64 work to ROUGOL, and the presentation is available on YouTube and through my presentation site. See <a href="https://presentations.riscos.online/pyromaniac4/index.html">https://presentations.riscos.online/pyromaniac4/index.…</a> for video, slides and resource links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RISC OS Pyromaniac screenshots and videos were updated with the details of the changes and work towards 64-bit. See <a href="https://pyromaniac.riscos.online/examples.html#talk2025">https://pyromaniac.riscos.online/examples.html#talk2025</a> for images and videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The RISC OS 64-bit C library has been updated with better handling of linking hidden and internal symbols, and `fgetc` now works properly. See <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-clib">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-clib</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>`objasm2gas` tool has been updated to handle `:INDEX:` and `:BASE:` (as well as the `@` metavariable), and fix problems with field mappings using registers not being calculated as expressions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The `Kernel: Introspection` component will be the next live coding project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyhow, that’s where things are for me. You can always follow the repositories to see what’s being done.</p>
<p>As usual, if anyone wants to contribute to these, please speak up.</p>

(date: 2025-12-12)
      <p>
      <p>This Monday will see an incredibly rare event take place – so rare, in fact, that there are more dentists for hens than occurences like this: The RISC OS User Group of London (ROUGOL) will hold a December meeting, with Rob Napier taking the virtual podium to talk about his current work-in-progress, an Acorn biography. Beaming himself from Nicholson, a small hamlet 300km from Melbourne, Australia, the meeting will be held online only, via Zoom – details below. Serving in the Air Force until four decades ago, Rob resigned his…</p>

      <h1>Setting up a new monitor</h1>

(date: 2025-12-10)
      <p>
      <blockquote>
<p>Perhaps a useful facility for RISC OS would be to be able to substitute a user-supplied EDID definition block during boot (pre-desktop).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can already do that. EDID blob files (with filetype &amp;F76) can be used in all the places an MDF can – you can drag and drop onto Display Manager’s icon bar icon, or <code>*LoadModeFile</code> it, and the monitor list shown in !Configure can chew them too if placed somewhere in the BootResources:Configure.Monitors to be scanned with the others.</p>

      <h1>Ilitek-tp touchscreen</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p>So I have this interesting device – it is a Raspad 3 (combined with a RP4b 4GB).</p>
<p>I am sure i recently got it to boot RISC OS 5.31 but it hasn’t done so again today so will have to play with it more. When it did boot the screen worked but not the touchscreen function (it’s RISC OS) – the touch screen works in Raspberry Pi OS and identifies as a ilitek-tp screen working on HDMI.</p>
<p>Has anyone got any idea if this can be made to work with RISC OS.</p>
<p>Apparently the ilitek-tp screen is a capacitive type device.</p>
<p>Also don’t think the USB ports on the main board (not the Rpi4) were working with RISC OS but let’s start with the screen.</p>
<p>If i can’t get it working with RISC OS then it may get used as a Pi-Core music player.</p>

      <h1>Proivde Simple 3D api to basic?</h1>

(date: 2025-12-09)
      <p>
      <p>RISC OS already support OpenGL. This wish list item would be to provide a simple module translating GL or VUlkan(?) calls to an appropriate SWI. in BASIC you would then do SYS “GLFunc”,“@”, PTR <code>param_block</code>.</p>
<p>Where GLFunc gets 2 pointers, 1(string) to the name of OPenGL(ES) or Vulkan Function, and the second param being a sutiable width pointer to the parameter block.</p>
<p>Alternatively it would be nice to have some kind of native 3D api, that can be called directly from Basic.</p>

      <p>It's hard being a purist programmer. You realise your small program need a function to do a particular thing, documentation suggests it exists in a module, so you import that module and... suddenly the compiler is pulling in a whole crapola of other dependencies and turns it into a bloated mess.</p>

      <h1>A Puzzling Addition to the Platform</h1>

(date: 2025-12-08)
      <p>
      <p>With uncharacteristic speed following the release of Puzzles 1.00 for RISC OS, version 1.01 is now available to download from <a href="https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/games">https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/games</a> – copies can also be found on the PlingStore, and should appear in PackMan shortly.</p>
<p>The main changes from 1.00 are a few updates <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/">from the upstream</a> – the user-facing ones are to the Dominosa, Mines and Undead games.</p>
<p>The RISC OS front end now supports the <code>text_fallback()</code> function, which allows it to make the characters in the top half of the current RISC OS character set available to games if they wish to make use of them. This improves the text display in a couple of the puzzles. If you’re playing Puzzles on a platform that doesn’t support the UCS lookup tables, or are using an alphabet that doesn’t have the desired glyphs in it, then games will continue to use plain ASCII as before.</p>

<p>Indeed, it does depend on having those high resolution printers or displays – not having them is unusual in business settings nowadays, but it’s probably still fairly common in domestic settings, and perhaps some smaller business settings – but surely not if they care much about fine detail?</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>I… cough… insert a single SYS “WImp_Poll” command every 100th READ or WRITE, or every 100th iteration of huge nested loops, to make it multi-task. Real programmers will probably shout: “Eek!”, but well, it works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s fine until the <strong>Wimp_Poll</strong> returns an event that you need to handle immediately… at which point, things can start to get very messy, very quickly… As soon as you start to add things like window redraw, a state machine hanging off Null events is often easier to make work. :-)</p>

      <h1>Hugh Bowman PI V1.14 Released - A new Original RISC OS Game!</h1>

(date: 2025-12-04)
      <p>
      <p>@AVB,</p>
<p>I wouldn’t bother. Pretty much every solution for running RISC OS applications supported sound. The ‘RISC OS On Linux’ project, totally understandably, hasn’t got around to that yet. And if you are just using typical desktop apps, then it’s no big deal. We are talking about one implementation here, with what, a handful of users. I’d be stunned if it was worth the effort.</p>
<p>Also, I think for most games, the sound is key too.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to spend time on it, I’d suggest a module which accepts the relevant SWIs/vectors/whatever for the sound APIs, and just does nothing with them. That would allow audio apps/games to start. In the future, some enterprising soul can figure out how to glue the module into talking to the Linux audio API.</p>

      <p>And on the subject of the RISC OS Filer, the fact that there is no standardised way to cause the LOADING of a file is utterly shameful, and purely a result of ideological not-invented-here silo-purity tribalism which everyone concerned should have grown out of in the school playground.</p>

      <p>Tiny RISC OS d’oh!</p>
<p>I was just documenting the Filer’s star commands (which are many, varied, and highly variant-dependent) when I noticed how bad RO5’s *Filer_DClickHold is.</p>
<p>This sets a delay which, if you hold the second click of a double-click for that time, simulates the Shift key.</p>

      <p>The BBC Micro is 44 years old today, Happy Birthday! However, many customers had to wait until early 1982 for delivery of theirs due to limited supply availability before Christmas. During its lifespan just over 1.5 million were sold - exact figures are not known. I still have my original one.</p>

      <p>I see the ROD/RCOmp crosscontamination continues. For everyone else, ClusterFS is not stable enough for release, but for RCOmp, its good enough to be put on a commercial computer that they sell. They just need to stop pretending that ROD is anything other than RCOmps fundraising wing.</p>

      <h1>Early ExtTheme almost ready for alpha testers</h1>

(date: 2025-11-30)
      <p>
      <p>To everyone interested,</p>
<p>I have completed testing the new Theme “Actuator” for my ExtTheme. At the moment, to load a new theme I am using CHris (Little Yellow Moon) original Theme Configure plug-in, but I need to rewrite that, because ExtTheme allow a use to customize a theme (and remembers the customizations between theme switching).</p>
<p>Check this link to have a look at which Themes are already available (there are more than the screenshots in the article), but this gives you an overview:</p>

<p>Note for Chris and Martin:</p>
<p>I am trying to write some documentation, as soon as I am done I’ll figure out a way for you both to be able to install this and start playing with it.</p>
<p>Please DO NOT use your daily RISC OS system for these tests! I need to replace the Configure plugin and the update may leave stuff behind! So this is just to test your own themes.</p>
<p>I am planning a public beta for Christmas if I have enough time.</p>

      <h1>Frosted Icon Set for 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-11-26)
      <p>
      <p>Ok guys,</p>
<p>let me disable the wobbly stuff (there are quite a few, because I started to reverse engineer WTB patch if anyone remebers it, to add it to my ExtTheme and allow even more customizability), I’ll package it and give it to both of you for testing.</p>
<p>It should take me a few days max.</p>
<p>ExtTheme already has all your work Chris for your old Theme Manager, so you’ll need to create a theme file with all the configuration options like you did in the past. The Theme file format is identical (I kept the same format for compatibility with the past Themes made for your TM). There are more options now, and it does work fine with coloring the windows border (well it can do even more than that, and add size to the border too, but that size is one of the wobbly functions).</p>
<p>It also already includes all the features of ThemeDef from ROOL, and everything is rewritten in C (’cause some folks complained that DME Launchpad was written in BBCBASIC…).</p>
<p>I’ll need both your emails, please contact me at the link below, and as soon as I have disabled the things that makes RO unstable I’ll send you a PackMan package that should install both the Configure UI and the Theme actuator.</p>
<p><a href="https://paolozaino.wordpress.com/contact/">https://paolozaino.wordpress.com/contact/</a></p>
<p>A required note: This is alpha quality code, so there might be issues even with the unstable features disabled.</p>
<p>One of the funniest unstable feature is having the iconbar on the left (or right or top) of the screen (yes can do that too), it works, BUT it also duplicate the iconbar XD – I am still fighting with that one, so will be disabled.</p>

      <p>Initially launched at the recent London Show, and now available to buy from !Store, the latest title from AMCOG Games is Hugh Bowman PI. In the game-noir, you play a private investigator called Hugh Bowman, and can take on one of three cases – all of which involve breaking into Professor Von Sparks’ compound. Once in, you can drive around the area, and enter individual buildings to search for clues and – eventually, hopefully – solve the case. In the compound itself, there are robots to avoid, although they temporarily…</p>

(date: 2025-11-25)
      <p>
      <p>Chris Wraight – aka Little Yellow Moon – is developing a new theme for RISC OS, called Clarity. His aim is to create a comprehensive new look for the desktop, to include window furniture and backgrounds, system icons, and a wide selection of common file types. There is a mini crowd-funder for the theme up and running, with a modest target of £250 (with, at the time of writing, 26% already fulfilled) – Chris explains that this is experimental; an investigation of using Ko-Fi to provide a small amount of…</p>

      <p>If you have a familiarity with flags and want to test your knowledge of them, or if you find yourself flummoxed by them and want to try to learn a few, Kevin Wells has a new piece of software that might be of interest. As you might guess from its name, FlagQuiz is a simple flag-based quiz. The application will display a flag, selected at random, and present you with four options for which nation it belongs to; choose one, and see if you got it right – and after…</p>

<p>No one has said anything about taking over anyone’s job, Not that i knew that certain individuals had roles reserved to themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don’t. But common sense says that when you have a platform running off a limited pool of volunteers, and also have volunteers happily in place doing some roles, it’s generally best to see if new volunteers can take on roles that aren’t already being done. Instead of finding out that the volunteers who you’ve just displaced from constructive roles have little interest in doing something else and have just buggered off into the sunset taking their skills with them.</p>
<p>If the original volunteers are looking for a change of scenery, on the other hand, then go for it. Obviously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do think the idea of a video with little interviews where possible of attendees and possibly exhibitors if possible would maybe help encourage people is a good one as it could complement the theatre talks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, although a small word of caution: it does need to be planned in advance (which can be before the show opens, if you’re not getting under people’s feet, or during the day), so that exhibitors know to expect an interview and don’t just have a live camera shoved in their face. Sorry, but the latter has happened before (as have other things that you might not expect – after many years exhibiting at events, I’ve learned the hard way that some corners of the RISC OS community are… odd). This may explain some of the cynicism being expressed. That’s also why recorded and edited is better than livestreamed: with the live option, some people may be unhappy with what gets out<a href="#fn2">2</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#fnr1">1</a> or have been misdirected?</p>
<p><a href="#fnr2">2</a> WROCC’s videos tend to be edited, I think. Usually just to remove the more blatant pauses and awkward bits, but sometimes to remove things that presenters have got cold feet over in the cold light of the next day.</p>

      <h1>Episode IV - A New Hope</h1>

(date: 2025-11-20)
      <p>
      <p>Not only did 1977 see the release of space opera <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/welcome/star-wars">Star Wars – A New Hope</a>, but it was also a year famous for the release of Fortran 77, the follow up to Fortran IV and ’66.</p>
<h3>Your compliance is imperative</h3>
<p>Fortran is one of a family of <em>imperative</em> programming languages, and was originally short for <strong>For</strong> mula <strong>Tran</strong> slation. Finding applications in scientific fields such as modelling of weather systems, molecular structure, and of course calculating star ship propulsion vectors.</p>
<p><img src="/images/risc_os_open/xwing.jpg" alt="Wireframe X-Wing"></p>
<p>Image available as wallpaper from <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1941346742">r33v01v3</a> via Steam</p>
<p>As described in our <a href="/content/documents/dde-faq">FAQ</a> the imperative languages are in the class of languages that the Norcroft compiler supports, and we’ve long known from odd scraps of evidence such as the <a href="http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/34486/Acorn-RISC-iX-User-Guide/">RISC iX User Guide</a> that there was a Fortran version at one time which went alongside the C language we’re so much more familiar with.</p>
<p>With help from Codemist a search of their archives managed to locate a partial copy last worked on in the 1990s on a backup tape stowed inside an old R2-unit.</p>
<p>Joining the Fortran front end – the part of the compiler which deals with language specifics – with the rest of the contemporary tools creates the <code>f77</code> compiler. In addition, a brand new 200+ page manual describes its use in detail, along with ANSI runtime library.</p>

      <h1>Time to Update !Killer :)</h1>

(date: 2025-11-18)
      <p>
      <p>A few things in no particular order.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There was a security permissions “gotcha” that we’d not spotted that came in during a gitlab update a few months ago that was preventing the automatic git mirroring occurring for the TCP/IP 6 project. This has now been resolved, so the code should now auto-update between the internal project git and the ROD git. As a result, the missing 7.09 code is now present as expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AFAIK that auto-mirroring only applies to that specific project, and happens more-or-less in realtime, so should always reflect latest code. Those wishing to contribute should contact us for further info. Other project repositories work as you would normally expect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vprotect and Killer sources are now in the ROD git. However, they are not publicly visible due to concerns over security, and there not being enough remaining skilled coders to provide the necessary levels of peer review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My goal would be for public binary builds to appear ASAP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to those git repositories is available on request, but it is likely we will vet applicants to at least some degree because of the sensitivity of the materials. We have already had one compelling offer to provide long term maintenance of this software, but I’m aware other work has been done and am keen to see all interested parties working together on this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hint about the Explore link was in the “Explore the github” but you can do so directly via <a href="https://gitlab.riscosdev.com/explore">https://gitlab.riscosdev.com/explore</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t expect to see the Vprotect/Killer projects in the public “explore” due to their sensitivity, until such time as releases are ready.</p>
</li>
</ol>

      <p>The next friendly fireside chat for people interested in RISC OS software development will take place at 7:30pm on Saturday, 22nd November. Taking place online via the Zoom video conferencing service, these meetings are intended as an informal way of allowing RISC OS programmers, and anyone interested in the subject, to get together online to discuss relevant matters. There is no set agenda for these online meetings, and instead the discussion is steered by what people want to talk about. People are free to ask questions or bring up (and…</p>

      <p>I've just reminded myself that not only are Greek and Cyrillic Alphabets routinely confused with UTF-8, even Latin1 is not immune - something as typographically unremarkable as &quot;×£&quot; would be misunderstood as &quot;ף&quot;, a Hebrew character.</p>
<p>This is why KeyPress must be interpreted in the current Alphabet.</p>

      <p>Your next opportunity to attend a RISC OS User Group of London (ROUGOL) meeting is Monday, 17th November, where Gerph will be discussing the evolution of RISC OS Pyromaniac. If you don’t already know, RISC OS Pyromaniac is an online resource developed by Gerph that provides a semi-hosted re-implementation of RISC OS, capable of running 32-bit programs with a focus on testing software. Gerph first talked about the system to ROUGOL five years ago this month, with the last follow-up talk four years ago – and if you want to…</p>

      <h1>Why is ROOL doing this?</h1>

(date: 2025-11-15)
      <p>
      <p>Ok, so maybe ‘random’ wasn’t strictly accurate, what I really do is use the same one swi allocation that was ever even approximately mine every time I write a module. From memory this includes the original use, a podule rom board to boot NFS, A broken driver for DE600 parallel Ethernet interface, a dot1Q vlan encapsulation layer (also broken) a driver for a bbc Winchester or Filestore drive on a Arc 1MHze bus podule, or more recently a DCI 4 implementation of the DCI2 ip over econet encapsulation, so I think I will get away with it for a while yet.</p>
<p>Clearly a web site you make an account on, confirm you email, upload the !Allocate file, which at least proves you are reasonably ligit, and emails you back and displays on the web page, would be very much better.</p>

<p>I continued working on !Svg2Draw, I added xlink decoding. I had problems with your old files because there is a element which is actually not used.</p>
<p>In your new version the tags remain but this element no longer has content and in this case my program works.</p>

      <h1>Toolbox File Format</h1>

(date: 2025-11-13)
      <p>
      <p>Yes, though remember Gadget is a variable size depending on the gadget. The original Toolbox manual describes it the best as it highlights various pitfalls.</p>
<p>Set num_gadgets and they then go sequentially in the ‘data’ field. Each gadget has a size, which is (usually) the offset to the next gadget.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.riscos.com/support/developers/toolbox/windows.html#26511">http://www.riscos.com/support/developers/toolbox/windo…</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.riscos.com/support/developers/toolbox/windows.html#14545">http://www.riscos.com/support/developers/toolbox/windo…</a></p>
<p>The pitfalls are that you shouldn’t assume the size of each header (ie. Window template or Gadget template) and instead use the offsets “The use of a body_offset field is to allow expansion in the header, without losing backwards compatibility.” Similarly ‘gadgets’ is an offset, in the Window template, and “type/size” has the gadget size in the gadget top two bytes (the second link above describes “type/size”).</p>
<p>For reading a file, you should handle the offsets properly, but the reality is they are just memory dumps of the C structures that have never changed size.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, it says “Note that for the gadgets listed below, the size is ‘built in’ to the Window module, and so the size can be set to zero…” which is ridiculous, so means you’ll have to hard-code the sizes for the original gadget set. I think you should use the built-in size if the value in the file is zero, and the value in the file if it’s non-zero.</p>

      <p>But do remember that the point of using Docker is so that you're not having to rebuild things everywhere - you can either use the image directly, or overlay additional content on it. If you want just the RPCEmu system that's in gerph/rpcemu-base. And of course, if you've any improvements to the system, PRs are always gratefully received.</p>

<pre><code>docker run -it --rm -p 5901:5901 -v $PWD:/riscos/Shared gerph/rpcemu-3.7

</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code>docker run -it --rm -p 5901:5901 -v $PWD:/riscos/Shared gerph/rpcemu-5

</code></pre>
<p>then connect to the VNC server (with Screen Sharing, or some other client) at localhost:5901 and use the password <code>password</code>.</p>
<p>The current working directory is shared into <code>$.Shared</code>.</p>
<p>As this is a separate configuration, a clean system, and has access to the filesystem it’s really trivial to customise, or just use for running those odd things that you need now and then. And you can be sure that you’ve not broken the system as it’s exactly as distributed.</p>
<p>The disc image is as supplied by the easy start bundles, with tiny tweaks (removing the Acorn logo from the backdrop, changing the screen mode to be larger, and adding a module that resizes the X server on mode change). This also has the interesting side effect of making the system rather more useable when made full screen.</p>
<p>And of course, being docker, you can also run this on Linux and on Windows, and it’ll be pretty much the same.</p>
<p>Sources, as usual, are on GitHub – <a href="https://github.com/gerph/rpcemu-docker">https://github.com/gerph/rpcemu-docker</a>. You can see the startlingly dumb way that the screen resolution is communicated out of the emulator in the VNCResize module. It’s certainly enough to work on the simple mode changes.</p>

      <h1>Moving back to Linux RPCEmu on my Mac</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>The macOS RPCEmu seems good to me on my home Mac - it's an older Intel mac though, so that might be some of the reason. However, using it with networking natively is much more difficult. I used to have it working, but on one upgrade or another it broke.</p>

      <p>I'm not sure how you're getting numbers so low on your Mac version. I just opened an old version I compiled a while back on my M1 Mac and get an average of just under 140 MIPS. Copying it over to an M4 Mac I have for work, it gets an average of around 220.</p>

      <h1>Floating Point in C</h1>

(date: 2025-11-11)
      <p>
      <p>I’ve got the score up over 900k, and once over 1m, by giving it more registers – I chose to set the baseline to allow the output to run on a PiZero which only has 8 D VFP registers. But 8 D registers means (under AAPCS) none are preserved over a function call. Giving it more would clearly be more efficient, but limits the h/w it can run on. I see apcs-softpcs (which I copied for VFP init) requests 16 D registers.</p>
<p>Curiously, 4 saved D FP registers outperforms 6 or 7 saved (ie. in addition to the 8 D arg registers) – I’ll investigate more as that shouldn’t really happen. ARM’s Norcroft currently has a limit of 31 registers (int + FP), due to its impressive use of signed maths throughout, so I can’t easily use 8 + 8.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a little bit of fiddling around … it now runs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s quite neat. Potentially could be useful, in fact, since my regression test harness (running on unix) can’t execute any code under RISC OS, only check the disassembled output. I was pondering ELF output for a Pi, but I’ve done all the work on a Mac (hence RPCEmu, hence forgetting about unaligned memory).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern, mainstream browsers tend to block insecure links/content in secure pages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yay, fewer spamages. It’s literally a one-line python http.server running as a very restricted user as I couldn’t be bothered to setup up a web server, but probably should one day.</p>

      <p>Looking at the RISC OS source, on reset the keyboard type is set to UK in KeyPostInit in Kernel/s/PMF/key. I have modified RISCOS.IMG so that this routine sets the type to USA instead of UK (by directly changing byte 0×458d4 of the RPi Stable 5.30 ROM image to 0×30, from 0×01 – there doesn’t seem to be any checksum on this binary image on the Pi).</p>
<p>As a workaround, this seems fine – now I have a default USA keyboard when booting directly to supervisor/BASIC.</p>

      <h1>Translating BASIC to C</h1>

(date: 2025-11-10)
      <p>
      <p>Long term readers of these fora may remember that I think Printer Manager is far too big to be extended to deal with IPP printers in its present BASIC form.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that it might be possible to translate it to C, in small increments, leaving it testable at all times, by translating bottom-up (i.e. replacing the lowest level functions and procedures first) and replacing them with calls to a module written in C. The module would only be needed until all the translation is done, by which time we’d have a complete translation into C that then would be converted from a module to an app.</p>
<p>Printer Manager is an enormous job to take on top-down, as nothing could be used until it’s all done. The way I’m suggesting would have something testable and usable (the ultimate test of testability!) at all stages.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>It’s not just praise that helps developers, as there are “faults” that aren’t actually technical failures.</p>

(date: 2025-11-07)
      <p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.svrsig.org/software/SuiteBound.zip">Guide to the Impression Suite</a> now comes with a complete worked example of how to turn a document into a RindBind manual. It starts with an Impression Publisher document which is the original manual for Equasor, TableMate etc. that was originally created in Impression. The process to print that as a PDF, then to extract individual Draw files for each page from that PDF is described in detail with examples at each stage. Packaging this into a ‘RingBind’ file is also described in detail with all the files created at each stage provided. As RingBind reserves space for the Draw file data for four pages, each the size of the largest individual Draw file for a page, it makes sense to reduce the few largest Draw files to a resolution appropriate to screen display rather than printing. The process to do this is also described. A copy of MakeDraw is required.</p>

      <h1>BBC BASIC - Simple OOP Extensions</h1>

(date: 2025-11-06)
      <p>
      <p>I have always thought that BBCBASIC needed records.</p>
<p>RTR’s BASICs have Structures, but the syntax doesn’t really feel native to BBCBASIC.</p>
<p>I have been a fan of Wirth’s Oberon with type extension of records as it is a clean simple concept.</p>
<p>Most OO languages go off into the weeds with very complex and subtle features that are not really needed for 99% of programs.</p>
<p>I have outlined a possible syntax/semantics for a simplified OOP style record structure description below.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>OUTLINE OF CONCEPT:</p>
<p>Defininng a record type</p>
<p>No Args (fixed size)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEF RECmyrec</p>
<p>A% // Integer field</p>
<p>B // Floating field</p>
<p>C$ // String field</p>
<p>D@ // Pointer field (any RECxxx) initial value NULL</p>
<p>DIM E% 1024 // Raw byte block field 1kB inline in record, use with indirection operators</p>
<p>DIM F%(9) // Array of 10 ints</p>
<p>DIM G(9) // Array of 10 floats</p>
<p>DIM H$(9) // Array of 10 strings</p>
<p>DIM I@(9) // Array of 10 pointer to record initial value NULL</p>
<p>ENDREC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With Args (variable size and initial values)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEF RECmyvarrec(n$,m%,blocksize%)</p>
<p>name<span class="math inline">\( = n\)</span> // Initialise value</p>
<p>DIM list$(m%) // n+1 strings – record contains a pointer to the array</p>
<p>DIM block% blocksize%*2+38 // can do calculations; specifies number of bytes, numbered 0 to result-1</p>
<p>ENDREC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Global or Private</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R@ = RECmyrec // Globals use the heap (I would prefer if the language had GLOBAL to specify global varsfor symmetry/clarity)</p>
<p>// this version of the creation syntax does not make it obvious that allocation is taking place here</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>GLOBAL R@ = RECmyrec // opt global designator</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>R@ = NEW RECobject // alternetive syntax choice for creating a new record, makes it explicit that record allocation is taking place.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>PRIVATE T@ = NEW RECmyrec // PRIVATEs use the heap. Same as PRIVATE in RTRBBCBASIC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>STATIC — used for “class variables/methods” see below</p>
<p>I prefer the use of NEW rather than DIM because DIM is already used for Arrays and Structures</p>
<p>Stack (LOCAL vars)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LOCAL S@ = NEW RECmyvarrec(“Bob”,9,256) // Locals also use the heap because we will often export the reference from the scope expecting the record to persist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When LOCAL pointer variable goes out of scope, the pointer on the stack is deleted, but the record (on heap) remains and may cause memory leaks,</p>
<p>CLEANUP should be used periodically.</p>
<p>If it is known that the record is no longer needed, it should be deleted before it goes out of scope.</p>
<p>The interpreter could detect escaping references and delete those that don’t, this can be complex with subtle errors, so manual or GC is easier.</p>
<p>Alternatively use Reference Counting (simpler, but risks memory leaks)</p>
<p>Delete Records and Release Heap Memory (manual GC)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEL p@ — frees the storage fields (strings, arrays, blocks) then frees the record, does NOT follow pointer fields.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>CLEANUP — executed outside any PROC or FN, marks all records reachable via global and private pointer variables then sweeps unmarked heap, does NOT follow pointers stored in Raw byte data blocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>Add all global &amp; static pointers to the keep queue</p>
<p>While keep queue not empty</p>
<p>….Pull the next pointer from the keep queue as current record</p>
<p>….If current record not marked</p>
<p>……..Add all pointers to records to the keep queue</p>
<p>……..Mark current record for retention</p>
<p>Sweep the record heap freeing all unmarked records using the DEL operation above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DELREC q@ — as DEL above, BUT it also follows pointer chains deleting all linked records, does NOT follow pointers stored in Raw byte data blocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>Add q@ to the delete queue</p>
<p>While delete queue not empty</p>
<p>….Pull the next pointer from the delete queue as current record</p>
<p>….If current record not marked</p>
<p>……..Add all pointers to the delete queue</p>
<p>……..Free all the storage fields</p>
<p>……..Mark current record for deletion</p>
<p>Sweep the record heap freeing all marked records</p>
<p>Access to fields</p>
<p>The field access operator is . followed by the name of a field.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>name<span class="math inline">\( = P@.name\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Procedure Fields / methods</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEF RECobject</p>
<p>A%</p>
<p>B%</p>
<p>DEF PROCmethod1(a%,b%) // LOCAL vars and params must not have the same name as a record field!</p>
<p>A%=a%-b%</p>
<p>B%=a%+b%</p>
<p>ENDPROC</p>
<p>DEF FNfunc1….</p>
<p>DEF PROCmethod2……</p>
<p>ENDREC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usage of procedure fields:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R@ = NEW RECobject // alternetive syntax choice for creating a new record, makes it explicit that record allocation is taking place.</p>
<p>R@.PROCmethod1(56,99)</p>
<p>q = R@.FNfunc1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Record Extension and overrides</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEF RECparent(args)</p>
<p>name$</p>
<p>DEF PROCmethod1:ENDPROC // an empty method, calling it does nothing, acts as a placeholder for later redefinition.</p>
<p>DEF PROCmethod2(blah%)</p>
<p>// Some code here</p>
<p>ENDPROC</p>
<p>DEF PROCmethod3(blah%)</p>
<p>// Some other code here</p>
<p>ENDPROC</p>
<p>DEF PROCmethod4:UNDEFINED:ENDPROC — an undefined method placeholder, calling it throws an error, must redefine, like abstract in other languages.</p>
<p>ENDREC</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>DEF RECchild1(args) EXTEND RECparent(arg exprs) // allows inherited fields to be initialised/dimensioned</p>
<p>address$ // a new field</p>
<p>DEF PROCmethod1 // this overrides any method with the same name, implements something for method1.</p>
<p>// Do something</p>
<p>ENDPROC</p>
<p>// PROCmethod2 is not defined here, so the one from the parent is inherited.</p>
<p>DEF PROCmethod3(blah%) // overrides PROCmethod3</p>
<p>// Do this</p>
<p>PARENT.PROCmethod3(blah%+8) — here we call PROCmethod3 from the parent.</p>
<p>// Do That</p>
<p>ENDPROC</p>
<p>DEF PROCmethod4 // this defines PROCmethod4 for the first time.</p>
<p>// Do something. Calling PARENT.method4 here throws an error (default halt program)</p>
<p>ENDPROC</p>
<p>ENDREC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PARENT</p>
<p>// passes control to an overridden method, that method may have been inherited through several levels of extension, it will activate the last matching definition.</p>
<p>THIS</p>
<p>// refers to the current object within a method, it is implied when accessing fields within methods.</p>
<p>TYPE$</p>
<p>// refers to the type of a record as a string e.g. “RECchild1”</p>
<p>TYPE</p>
<p>// refers to the type of the record internal representation, can be used for type tests</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IF THIS.TYPE = RECchild1 THEN …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TYPE and TYPE$ work on any pointer variable as well. to allow type comparisons (compare 2 pointers or pointer against TYPE value):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IF R@.TYPE = P@.TYPE // do they have the same dynamic type?</p>
<p>IF R@.TYPE &lt;&gt; RECsometype // R@ is NOT pointing to a RECsometype?</p>
<p>IF R@.TYPE &gt; P@.TYPE // is R@ pointing to a supertype of P@?</p>
<p>IF R@.TYPE &gt;= P@.TYPE // is R@ the same OR a supertype of P@?</p>
<p>IF R@.TYPE &lt; RECparent // is R@ a subtype of RECparent?</p>
<p>IF R@.TYPE &lt;= RECparent // is R@ the same as or a subtype of RECparent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calling an undefined method is a fatal error and will halt the program.</p>
<p>Fields are not redefined/overridden and must only be named once in an extension chain.</p>
<p>There is no multiple inheritance, interfaces, generics as these are complex and hard to do correctly.</p>
<p>Managing Namespace Pollution and example of “class” var/method</p>
<p>If a program has a large number of record types with lots of internal fields and methods that the user of the record does not need to touch the interface becomes a confusing mess.</p>
<p>Most OOP languages allow marking fields and methods as private/public, etc</p>
<p>I propose that for the BASIC extension above that all fields and methods are private by default and only visible inside the REC structure and by any child REC that extends from it.</p>
<p>To make things visible to the program at large, fields and methods are marked with an export mark ‘&lt;-’</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEF RECobject</p>
<p>&lt;- A% // A% is visible to the whole program as MyPtr@.A%</p>
<p>B% // B% is only visible to methods inside RECobject fatal error to attempt access outside.</p>
<p>&lt;- STATIC C% // this is global to all instances of RECobject</p>
<p>&lt;- DEF PROCmethod1(a%,b%) // Can be called anywhere as MyPtr@.PROCmethod1(…)</p>
<p>A%=a%-b%</p>
<p>B%=a%+b%</p>
<p>ENDPROC</p>
<p>DEF FNfunc1 // Can be called inside PROCmethod1 or PROCmethod2 or FNfunc1 as THIS.FNfunc1(…) or PARENT.FNfunc1 (if inherited)</p>
<p>= C%</p>
<p>&lt;- DEF PROCmethod2 // Can be called anywhere as MyPtr@.PROCmethod2(…)</p>
<p>A% = THIS.FNfunc1</p>
<p>ENDPROC</p>
<p>&lt;- STATICDEF PROCdouble // affects all instances, can be called without any live instance</p>
<p>C% = C% * 2 // Can only manipulate STATIC fields and call STATIC methods/functions</p>
<p>ENDPROC</p>
<p>ENDREC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The exported API of this REC is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DEF RECobject</p>
<p>&lt;- A% // A% is visible to the whole program as MyPtr@.A%</p>
<p>&lt;- STATIC C% // this is global to all instances of RECobject</p>
<p>&lt;- DEF PROCmethod1(a%,b%) // Can be called anywhere as MyPtr@.PROCmethod1(…)</p>
<p>&lt;- DEF PROCmethod2 // Can be called anywhere as MyPtr@.PROCmethod2(…)</p>
<p>&lt;- STATICDEF PROCdouble // affects all instances, can be called without any live instance</p>
<p>ENDREC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example usage outside the definition</p>
<p>RECobject.C% = 5 // set the class var C% to 5 for all RECobjects</p>
<p>R@ = NEW RECobject</p>
<p>R@.PROCmethod1(20,10)</p>
<p>PRINT R@.A% // prints 10</p>
<p>R@.PROCmethod2</p>
<p>PRINT R@.A% // prints 5</p>
<p>DEL R@ // delete the record</p>
<p>RECobject.PROCdouble // there are no live instances at this time</p>
<p>p@ = NEW RECobject</p>
<p>p@.PROCmethod1(100, 15)</p>
<p>PRINT p@.A% // prints 85</p>
<p>p@.PROCmethod2</p>
<p>PRINT p@.A% // prints 10, as C% was doubled by PROCdouble</p>
<p>DEL p@ // delete the record</p>

      <p>Here's a Sinclair Microdrive cartridge with a UK pound coin for comparison. We trusted these mini-magnetic tape loops with our valuable data in the 1980s. Totally insane! To be fair, they were actually quite reliable. The tape loop is 5 metres long and stores a minimum of 85 to 100KBytes of data.</p>

      <p>Moldy disks - my pet hate! Especially when you have important disks to try and archive. This Aculab DASH-80 system disk is probably the only one in existence. I have managed to recover most of it after a lot of cleaning. A bit more work and I can hopefully fully recover.</p>

      <h1>Live Coding with Gerph, Sunday 2nd November at 1pm.</h1>

(date: 2025-11-02)
      <p>
      <p>Quite a slow session today; lots of chatter about other things, but also a lot of explaining why I’ve planned things the way that I have, and how I’m doing this work.</p>
<p>The repository – <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-wimp-templates">riscos-wimp-templates</a> – has a simple build and CI environment that tests things. We can open a file and close it – that’s pretty much it. But I’ve also created a simple module that lets us call the SWIs that are defined.</p>
<p>The modules, such as they are, can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status">riscos64-status</a> repository, as usual.</p>
<p>Interestingly, at the end, I used `PicoC` to perform the test on RISC OS 64, as there isn’t a useful 64bit RISC OS BASIC on there – I never got around to making the SDLBASIC do SWI calls properly.</p>
<p>Next week, I’ll be continuing, I think. Working on the Window and Icon decoding from the templates.</p>

      <h1>Learning BASIC</h1>

(date: 2025-11-01)
      <p>
      <p>Last year I spent many ‘happy’ months writing these short guides. Having taught English abroad for 13 years I learned the hazards of ‘teacher talk’ and as you can see these volumes contain only code, with some image [usually of what the code produces on screen], but without the usual waffle most other programming books contain.</p>
<p>The title ‘The Happy Hacker’ was inspired by a song of the same name written by Chris Jeffers for the Alto computer over at Xerox PARC. [ <a href="https://soundcloud.com/audimprove/happy-hacker">https://soundcloud.com/audimprove/happy-hacker</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/111334072">https://vimeo.com/111334072</a>].</p>
<p>Last week I reviewed all of the code and came up with one small improvement:</p>
<p>Rotate {Volume 1, page 12}</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>REPEAT</p>
<p>MOUSE x,y,button</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>ELSE</p>
<p>WAIT &lt;———-add this to smooth rotation!</p>
<p>PROCplot_points</p>
<p>PROCrotate</p>
<p>PROCplot_points</p>
<p>ENDIF</p>
<p>UNTIL button &lt;&gt; 0</p>
<p>The original does NOT contain the ‘WAIT’ command – it still works but not smoothly.</p>
<p>I also made some additional content, not yet included in this Happy Hacker series, which I may include in ‘Volume 14’ one day.</p>

The application was first developed in the late 1990s by Jonathan Duddington, and Martin will go into detail about its history, leading up to it becoming open source and still maintained even though its creator has moved on to other things.

      <p>45 years ago, the arcade game PAC-MAN was launched in North America ( October 1980 ). It was an instant hit and soon became one of the most iconic videgames of all time. 100s of copy-cat versions were created for home computers, virtually all were un-licensed. One of my all-time favourite games.</p>

      <p>Thanks for that. It looks like we’re mostly aligned. Keeping the non-RISC OS 5 clearly marked in the wiki helps avoid any confusion for people (notably developers) who are downloading RISC OS 5 from elsewhere on our site, or looking at the sources in our repo.</p>
<p>I would say that you announcing things or presenting things is great, but it isn’t equivalent to contacting us directly or even posting in the Code Review forum to discuss anything that will consume shared identifiers or flags. ROLL unfortunately doesn’t have the people or the bandwidth to proactively track everything going on in all the RISC OS-community and adjacent projects. If we’ve given mixed messages in the past, then I apologise for that.</p>
<p>That aside, it’s great to see people actively thinking about and working on paths that move RISC OS forward and out of the current 32-bit only shackles.</p>

      <p>Way back in 1998 I was working on my first PC title, 'Incoming'. I was tasked with CPU &amp; GPU optimizations and 3D card compatibility. Back then PC 3D cards were in their infancy and had lots of issues, mostly associated with their drivers. Sometimes we had to work around know problems with hacks!</p>

      <p>#MeToo. If it’s of interest, this is still an issue with the current ROM. Somehow it loses reference to Resources:$.Resources.UK.Messages and then many things (like *Time, Configure’s time&amp;date and keyboard sections) stop working, with the error message being day-dependent ’cos the token being looked up is.

      <p>A pretty excellent session (excluding the section where I left the audio off! oops!). Code variable private words are now in, the testing from RISC OS Pyromaniac has been added, and all passes, and it’s doing everything it needs to. It’s pretty much complete.</p>
<p>I might spend a little time on optimisations next week, to make it a bit more performant, if people are interested in that. If not, then next week I shall move on to another project.</p>

      <h1>Creatng an ebook - &#39;part 2&#39;</h1>

(date: 2025-10-26)
      <p>
      <p>I’m now asking for info wrt a slightly different situation where I want to be able to make an ebook from a set of numbered jpeg files, one per page.</p>
<p>This is to generate ‘de-oxidised’ versions of PDFs of ancient pulp mags/paperbacks and render them in a far easier form to read.</p>
<p>I can export the jpegs OK. I can also write a Composcript to generate a new set of jpegs that have been ‘de-browned’. But I then need to put those into a new PDF with one jpeg per page. The result then to be more easily read using the usual ebook reading progs on my natty tablet device. (I’ll probably also greyscale the pages in most cases if they’re ‘colour’ jpegs with black text on the brown of oxidised pulp paper.</p>
<p>I don’t mind if the process has to take some time to chug though hundreds of jpegs, I can get a cup of single-estate tea and a biscuit as my RO box does the job. Problem at present is that some anient pulp mags/books are almost unreadable due to becoming oxidised and the the PDF /ebook maker didn’t bother to deal with that. But I suspect a tool like this would be very handy for anyone who wants to read material that exhibits this problem.</p>
<p>And I suspect that for me this RO approach will be easier than trying to work out how to automate the process on Linux as I already know how to use !Compo, etc, for the actual processing. Just not the bit where the resulting bitmaps need to be packed into a PDF (…or other ebook format? Is there one that just ‘zips’ the pages with some meta-info to guide ebook rendering? That might be handy!)</p>

      <h1>Stop The Presses - Last Minute RISCOSbits News and Special Offers</h1>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p>In last minute stop-press news, RISCOSbits are pleased to announce a few additions to the London Show stand.</p>
<p>For those of you who are in the market for a RISC OS laptop, RISCOSbits may have exactly what you are looking for at the London show! We will have VERYLIMITED stock of Linux enabled, but RISC OS capable Pinebook Pros available for sale at the London show. Whilst these laptops are not fitted with RISC OS for licencing reasons, we can demonstrate them running RISC OS to show you that it is possible and easy to do. All you will need to do is pop along to another stand at the show and purchase access to the ROM.</p>
<p>As people may be aware, there are two variants of Pinebook Pro – one with a UK layout keyboard, and one with a more generic (US) layout. We will have the latter available.</p>
<p>The Pinebook Pro comes equipped with 64GB of eMMC storage preinstalled and pre-formatted for RISC OS use. The laptops (running Linux) will be available on a “first come, first served” basis for only £150 – remember, stocks are very limited. We also have a super bargain special offer on one with a slight donk on the top rim of the shell. Doesn’t affect the functionality, but we’ll knock a further <strong>£25 off!</strong></p>
<p>Our next bit of <strong>exclusive</strong> news is we’ll be selling external antennas for Compute Module 4 systems, especially those in metal cases. Many of you will be aware that the Linux method of enabling this using dtparams doesn’t work on RISC OS, but by partnering with Stader Software, we are able to offer exclusive free access to antenna control software for RISC OS to enable the external antenna.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, if you buy a system with a WiFi- enabled Compute Module 4 from our FreeNVMe or FAST range and you ask for an antenna, we’ll give it you for free, including exclusive access to the control software for RISC OS. Combine this with our ‘Get In Free*’ <a href="https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/20069">offer</a> and you’re making incredible savings! It’s also worth remembering we publish the prices and specifications of our systems on our <a href="https://www.riscosbits.co.uk/systems.htm">website</a> so you can calculate the bang per buck you get with RISCOSbits!</p>
<p>We’ll also have a few gold and black case badges to tell the world what’s running inside your otherwise anonymous case! And at a pocket money price of only £2.50!</p>
<p>And the final teaser is we’ll be bringing along some delightful Welsh slate drinks mats, engraved with your favourite OS logo. Available for just £5 each, they’re sure to make your desk look oh so pretty and er, ringless. You could even buy a set of four for £18 for your coffee table or home cocktail bar!</p>
<p>So ‘coast’ on over to our stand to grab yours!</p>

      <h1>RCI Hardware at London Show - 20ukp off too</h1>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <ul>
<li>
<p>We’ll be knocking 20ukp off all hardware items (over 50ukp) at the show.</p>
<p>You don’t need to quote any adverts or phrases or claim anything special.</p>
<p>Just money off for everyone :) **</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the recent Show Preview user group meeting, Andrew Rawnsley of RCI</p>
<p>demonstrated some new hardware items that had been proving popular this</p>
<p>summer, and will be available at the London Show this weekend.</p>
<p>18 inches of RISCBook</p>
<p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=</p>
<p>First up was a new 18&quot; RISCBook laptop. For those unfamiliar, the</p>
<p>RISCBook range of laptops run RISC OS and Windows together, providing the</p>
<p>best of both RISC OS and Windows software, with links between the two OSs</p>
<p>to allow them to share resources such as files, printers, clipboard, and</p>
<p>networking.</p>
<p>The pressing onset of Windows 11 has prompted a number of users to upgrade</p>
<p>this Autumn, and the 18&quot; laptop has proven popular. Although 18&quot; may</p>
<p>sound huge for a laptop, screen shapes have become more flexible in recent</p>
<p>times, and the 18&quot; uses a 16:10 ratio with more vertical space for</p>
<p>documents. This means it is roughly the same size/weight as a 17&quot; laptop,</p>
<p>whilst offering more screen space (1920×1200). Very practical for working</p>
<p>on documents, and the high refresh rate (144 Hz) IPS panel looks lovely.</p>
<p>We’ve found that as people age, they appreciate the larger screens and</p>
<p>full size backlit keyboards (with number pads), whilst finding the</p>
<p>convenience of a laptop is easier to fit in various rooms. For example,</p>
<p>RCI’s Allan (Andrew’s father) now uses his laptop downstairs to save</p>
<p>having to trek up to the more traditional machines in his office upstairs.</p>
<p>Whilst the laptops aren’t RISC OS friendly when they arrive, RCI is able</p>
<p>to adapt them to run RISC OS beautifully, with smooth performance and</p>
<p>flexible software compatibility (run both 26bit and 32bit applications).</p>
<p>Touchpad mouse gestures (eg. 3 finger tap) mean that replication of the</p>
<p>three button mouse is great too. Of course, you can plug in a mouse (or</p>
<p>use a wireless one) too.</p>
<p>These laptops are no slouches – 8-core, 16 thread AMD chips amply</p>
<p>demonstrate why AMD have become so dominant again recently – they can</p>
<p>motor through anything from web browsing to video editing. Whilst the</p>
<p>graphics are on-chip, they’re top tier for what they are, making games</p>
<p>possible too. With 16GB RAM and 1TB of storage packed into a slim and</p>
<p>low-weight chassis, there’s a lot of “oomph” inside.</p>
<p>Of course, RCI offers a range of other RISCBooks too, from 13&quot; upwards</p>
<p>with a variety of screens including OLED. However, these 18&quot; units have</p>
<p>proven quite popular, and so we’re singling them out to RISC OS users.</p>
<p>The laptops should be on display in London. Expect to see RCI’s MiniPC</p>
<p>range too.</p>
<p>Pinebook Pros</p>
<p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=</p>
<p>Speaking of Laptops, RCI still have one or two Pinebook Pros – they grab</p>
<p>stock from around the world when they appear online. Pinebook Pros offer</p>
<p>a fantastic native-RISC OS experience with class leading performance,</p>
<p>working wifi, and even optional NVMe sockets for high speed storage.</p>
<p>Prices fluctuate as limited availability often results in price spikes,</p>
<p>but RCI is trying to keep prices in the same ballpark as before.</p>
<p>N.Ex.T, Hydra and NVMe</p>
<p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-</p>
<p>RCI will also be showing N.Ex.T and Hydra systems as usual – expect to see</p>
<p>large NVMe drives and some exciting new features. See the latest v9 (and</p>
<p>the forthcoming v10) NVMe drivers with SMART disc health features and</p>
<p>drive health checks. See native RISC OS disc partitions, 4K sectors, our</p>
<p>NVMe toolkit and more.</p>
<p>Hydra shows how Pi4 and Pi5 tech can be used side-by-side, and you’ll be</p>
<p>able to see ROD’s new RISC OS Direct for Pi5 running on a Hydra Head.</p>
<p>Check out the tiny mini.pi N.Ex.T computer which packs almost every</p>
<p>feature into the tiniest box, at a cracking price.</p>
<p>There will also be some rather different devices shown with up to 8 NVMe</p>
<p>slots! Aimed at file sharing and home NAS appliances, these small silent</p>
<p>boxes provide exceptional capabilities at surprisingly affordable prices,</p>
<p>whilst opening up a range of options for RISC OS and allowing room to</p>
<p>expand and grow. Come and find out more at the show.</p>
<p>RISCube Minis</p>
<p>=-=-=-=-=-=-=</p>
<p>We’ve talked about RISCBooks, but 2025 has also bee the year of MiniPCs</p>
<p>with our range of RISCube Minis offering state of the art features and</p>
<p>stunning performance at lower-than-ever prices. See features like the</p>
<p>latest USB4, multiple 4K+ displays, Wifi 6E and 7, 2.5 Gbit ethernet and</p>
<p>more – all useable from RISC OS!</p>
<p>Monitors</p>
<p>=-=-=-=-</p>
<p>We’ll have a selection of IPS and OLED displays available on the stand for</p>
<p>you to check out and plan the best way to make your day-to-day computing</p>
<p>more pleasurable. Remember your screen determines everything you see and</p>
<p>do on the computer, so if you’re an enthusiast (and coming to a computer</p>
<p>show counts as an enthusiast!) then you deserve the best you can.</p>
<p>Monitor prices have come down a bit recently, so why not take advantage of</p>
<p>that to treat yourself?</p>
<p>Whatever takes your fancy, come and check out our range at the RCI stand</p>
<p>at the show and say hello!</p>

      <h1>Show Offer</h1>

(date: 2025-10-24)
      <p>
      <p>The 368 page Impression User Manual (in the form of a PDF file) was originally provided free to purchasers of Impression X. This User Manual is now available in electronic form free to all users of Impression Style (which is free to download from !Store), Publisher and Publisher Plus from !Store.</p>
<p>A printed version of the manual is still available, normal price £25, which includes a personal download link for Impression Publisher Plus version 5.13, courtesy of RISC OS Developments. I shall be discounting the few remaining copies of this manual at the show.</p>
<p>Although the User Manual was created in Impression, with contents and index created automatically, the PDF that was produced was designed to produce a printed manual. It therefore has no internal links. The RingBind version of the User Manual does have page to page links from the Contents pages, section to section and all 12 pages of the Index.</p>
<p>I shall be handing out USB sticks at the show free of charge with the latest version of !FamTree, version 1.58 (May 2024) [which will be made free to download from !Store after the show]. The USB sticks are only 32Mbytes so you can have as much of the other software listed below as will fit – for example a RingBind version of the RISC OS 5.30 User Manual (with over 3000 internal links) or both RingBind and PDF versions of the Impression User Manual. If you want more then I’ll put it on your own USB stick or another 32MB stick. No individual zip file is larger than 14Mbytes. At least until stocks run out…</p>
<p>This amounts to over 242M bytes of data all on a 128Mbyte USB stick.</p>

      <h1>London is closer than you think</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>This year’s <a href="https://www.riscoslondonshow.co.uk/">London show</a> organised by <a href="https://rougol.jellybaby.net/">ROUGOL</a> is this Saturday the 25th October from 11am. Shows are the perfect opportunity to meet and talk to fellow RISC OS users and developers about what they’re doing with our favourite operating system.</p>
<p><img src="/images/risc_os_open/shows/rougol2025.png" alt="Show banner"></p>
<h3>Venue details</h3>
<p>A short distance by public transport, around ten miles from Heathrow airport, less than four miles from the M1 motorway, the Harrow District Masonic Centre is closer than you think; see this Google <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vqigUNhWUqDjfXEH6">map</a> for directions.</p>
<p>Please note: engineering work means <strong>the Bakerloo tube line is closed</strong> this weekend.</p>
<h3>See BASIC in action</h3>
<p>See the alpha version of BBCBASIC rewritten in C, running natively on both RISC OS 5 and Windows x64, and find out what’s required to get it all finished. It’s a considerable technical effort, and will pave the way for all kinds of language extensions in future.</p>
<p>Want to know why nightly builds of BASIC gained a new <a href="https://gitlab.riscosopen.org/RiscOS/Sources/Programmer/BASIC/-/merge_requests/16">SYS-as-a-function keyword</a> recently? It’s all part of the <a href="/content/documents/risc-os-moonshots">mission to the moon</a>.</p>

      <h1>NetFetch 6 new available</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>R-Comp are launching version 6 of NetFetch at the London show, over six years since v5.5 launched at Wakefield 2019.</p>
<p>(Spoiler – it’s live now on !Store)</p>
<p>NetFetch provides flexible mail and news fetching for RISC OS, including anti spam and other filtering capabilities, as well as a friendly front end to RISC OS internet-related software. A version of Messenger Pro is included to provide users with a “ready to use” kit.</p>
<p>Since the release of v5.5, email provision has changed quite substantially. Many more ISPs require enhanced security in a variety of forms – more passwords and logins, more SSL/TLS encryption, greater identity checks and so on. NetFetch 6 recognises this and has revamped its configuration to emphasise the features that modern people require. New and returning users will find that setting up NetFetch 6 is considerably improved, especially with modern ISPs.</p>
<p>These improvements have been brought about because internet providers such as Orpheus and Plusnet have both undergone changes recently, and whilst helping user sort out their problems, we discovered various areas that</p>
<p>needed to be improved or made clearer. Version six reflects these, modernising and improving the experience.</p>
<p>News handling has also seen a revamp, as many ISPs no longer offer newsgroup facilities. Those that do often require username/password login, so the old setup routines no longer made sense. We have now taken news out of the initial setup to streamline things, and instead introduced a new Assistant to guide people through setting up free newsgroup access regardless of ISP. By following the built-in assistant, and filling out two boxes, you’ll be able to get newsgroup access set up whenever you’re ready. Meanwhile, existing users will appreciate clearer settings, and easy support for both server login and SSL/TLS.</p>
<p>Speaking of encryption, v6 sees support added for the latest TLS 1.3 standard including handshake-level identity checks. These are conducted as part of the TLS connection to prove you are who you say you are – something that we have seen mandated on real-world “big company” TLS 1.3 servers.</p>
<p>NetFetch 6 will be available as a paid-for upgrade to existing customers, launching at the London show, but anyone who has purchased v5.5 this year (2025) can claim a free upgrade by specifying their purchase date when</p>
<p>ordering. Version 6 will be available in person at the show and via !Store download.</p>
<p>NetFetch 6 costs 35ukp new, with upgrades costing 20ukp either in person or via !Store. The new version is live now on !Store and as with its predecessor, includes free updates for the foreseeable future (6 years again? Can’t promise, but who knows!).</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

      <h1>Free entry at the London Show 2025 with RISCOSbits*</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>*it’s okay, ROUGOL, we’re not sneaking people in through a side entrance!</p>
<p>To celebrate the first show outing of our updated and very latest release of FreeNVMe genuinely open source drivers, RISCOSbits are offering to refund people’s entrance fee, by way of an extra discount on all purchases of NVMe-enabled pre-built systems at our stand.</p>
<p>Terms and conditions obviously apply (we’ll only offer one refund per customer) but we’re happy if you get together with a RISC OS friend and send your mate up to buy another NVMe system on your behalf to get a second discount!</p>
<p>Simply quote ‘Oi! Gimme my door money back’ when making your purchase and we’ll knock it off the price!</p>
<p><strong>About FreeNVMe</strong></p>
<p>FreeNVMe is the next generation of fully Open Source RISC OS storage technology and it’s completely free!</p>
<p>As the result of partnering with Stader Softwareentwicklung and RISC OS Open, RISCOSbits have been instrumental in developing, and further updating, the free and fully Open Source NVMe driver and filing system, that we first demonstrated way back in December 2023. And it has been in reliable use on RISCOSbits’ Compute Module 4 systems ever since.</p>
<p>Designed from the ground up to fit perfectly with existing RISC OS filesystems, FreeNVMe follows all the usual filecore conventions so that all existing tools, such as DiscKnight, work straight out of the box – no custom tools are required.</p>
<p>A conscious decision was made to adopt the existing standards for filing systems, so that any developments to the core of RISC OS would automatically integrate with FreeNVMe.</p>
<p>There’s no tie-in to a paid-for support scheme – our driver is designed to work with the nightly builds from RISC OS Open. And it’s completely free. You can download it now, without having to buy a system, an NVMe drive or anything else:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.riscosbits.co.uk/nvme/">www.riscosbits.co.uk/nvme/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/raspberry-pi">https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/raspberry…</a></p>
<p>And FreeNVMe is genuinely open source. You can look at, and download, the source code directly from the RISC OS Open repository NOW. You have the opportunity to contribute to the code to improve FreeNVMe and make it into the real community-led filing system it was intended to be.</p>
<p>FreeNVMe is designed to offer the following features as standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Works on Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 systems</li>
<li>4Kn sectors to allow for drives up to 2TB</li>
<li>Partitioning via freely available software</li>
<li>DiscKnight compatibility</li>
<li>Standard file system icon (no separate app needed)</li>
<li>Dual format drives with separate icons for each format.</li>
</ul>
<p>And FreeNVMe is FAST! So fast that we felt comfortable incorporating it into our premium range of computers without any hidden charges.</p>
<p><strong>What’s New</strong></p>
<p>In our latest developments, rather than chasing irrelevant numbers, we’ve been focusing on real-world usability and integration – from more reliable file handling and faster boot times to improved support for large storage volumes and smoother performance under pressure. At the show, you’ll be able to see how NVMe, when properly harnessed, makes RISC OS feel more modern, stable, and capable than ever before. We’ve also improved drive compatibility to near 100% – there’ll always be rogue drives, but we’ve even built in a system to manage them.</p>
<p>We don’t need to make strangely calculated claims about how it compares to other products – we just give it to you for nothing so you can make your own mind up!</p>

(date: 2025-10-23)

      <p>Another announcement has popped up, this time from RCI, R-Comp Interactive (aka RCI – R-Comp’s sister company), about an updated release of their NVMe drivers. This is what Andrew Rawnsley’s email said: R-Comp Interactive is pleased to announce that version 9d of our NVMe Drivers are now available. Since the drivers are already incredibly fast (up to 80% faster than competing products), and work with a wide variety of drives, the focus this time has been on expanding functionality, features and the experience for both users and developers.

      <h1>PhotoDesk 3.25 released</h1>

(date: 2025-10-23)
      <p>
      <p>We are pleased to announce that version 3.25 of PhotoDesk is now available to download for existing users via !Store.</p>
<p>Following on from 3.24’s colossal number of changes, 3.25 is a much smaller affair, correcting a few things that slipped through and have been reported since:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“click_in_rotate” routine called “click_in_draw” with the incorrect number of paramters. Now fixed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resize and Rotate functions had Bi-cubic and Bi-linear modes swapped. Expected operation has been restored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PNG files were being saved without compression, leading to very large files. Since PNG compression is lossless, this was not sensible, so PNGs are now compressed as you’d expect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The update is available as a free download for anyone who purchased the XAT edition (3.18+) of PhotoDesk some years ago.</p>
<p>We will have a number of fresh CDs with 3.25 on at the London Show this weekend. We offer them as very low cost “stocking stuffers” for existing users. The CDs contain extra software (3.25 adds Chris Terran’s GradGrind palette editor designed for use with PhotoDesk) that wouldn’t fit in the regular download, plus extras like full sets of example images and documentation etc.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a CD drive, bring a USB stick (we do sell them, but they tend to be larger ones) and we’ll copy the CD contents onto the stick for you.</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

      <p>
      <p>With this year’s London Show drawing ever nearer – the doors will be open to the public in just two days on 25th October, at the Harrow District Masonic Centre – another announcement has landed in the RISCOSitory bunker, and, amongst other interesting news, this one includes something we’ve all been eagerly awaiting for a very long time: a public release of web browser Iris from RISC OS Developments.

(date: 2025-10-22)
      <p>
      <p>With the London Show now so close you can almost taste it – okay, I might be confusing the show with my snack – another software update has been announced by R-Comp, with immediate availability via !Store, and the option to buy at the show. This time the update is to PhotoDesk: We are pleased to announce that version 3.25 of PhotoDesk is now available to download for existing users via !Store. Following on from 3.24’s colossal number of changes, 3.25 is a much smaller affair, correcting a few things…</p>

      <h1>RISCOSbits at London 2025</h1>

(date: 2025-10-21)
      <p>
      <p>We are pleased to announce that RISCOSbits will be exhibiting at the RISC OS London Show on Saturday, 25th October 2025. As a continuation of our commitment to providing high-quality, great value and innovative RISC OS systems, we’re bringing along a full range of new and improved products for users of all levels—from casual tinkerers to serious power users.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to get hands-on with our most advanced systems to date, including the blazingly fast FIRE systems with capacity for up to four full speed SATA SSDs (potentially 8TB of RISC OS format storage!), our sleek and compact VENOM, eNVY.Me and PiRO Qube NVMe machines.</p>
<p>You’ll also be able to get your hands on one of our new FAST NVMe XL systems, upgraded to 8GB of useable RAM! Good luck trying to use all that!</p>
<p><strong>The DIY Range</strong></p>
<p>We’re also excited to show off our DIY product range – a collection of hands-on kits that let you build your very own RISC OS computer. Whether you’re a seasoned hardware builder or just fancy getting under the hood, there’s something here for you.</p>
<p>Our entry-level system offers a compact 85mm x 110mm design, powered by a 2GHz CPU and 2GB RAM, with 128GB NVMe storage and a 32GB SD card to run RISC OS from. It’s simple, snappy, and just £119 – a great way to get started.</p>
<p>For those who want a little more flexibility, our mid-range kit expands to a 140mm x 120mm footprint and includes a more versatile selection of ports, 32GB of eMMC storage, 128GB of NVMe storage and USB-C and barrel jack power options – ideal for more advanced projects, priced at £179.</p>
<p>At the top end of the range is our DIY powerhouse system, featuring a 2.2GHz CPU, 4GB RAM, 32GB eMMC, a 256GB NVMe drive, and a custom designed wooden case that you can finish and personalise yourself. It’s the ideal choice for users who want customisability without sacrificing power or style, available for £199.</p>
<p>All kits come with pre-configured software, essential components, clear instructions, and zero soldering required. Just add your own screwdriver – and maybe a cup of tea!</p>
<p>For more details, see our new website at <a href="http://www.riscosbits.co.uk">www.riscosbits.co.uk</a></p>
<p><strong>Showcases at RISC OS London</strong></p>
<p>We’ll also be lifting the lid on two exciting new developments currently in the works. First up is a brand new dual-OS computer system, mini.BOB. This little beast synergises the best hardware elements of Linux and RISC OS into one seriously powerful unit, all within a tidy, ultra-small footprint case. If you’ve ever dreamed of a seamless crossover between two platforms in a compact and efficient package, this might just be it.</p>
<p>We’ll be demonstrating the results of our ongoing work in enhancing NVMe functionality across the RISC OS platform. Rather than just chasing numbers, we’ve been focusing on real-world usability and integration – from more reliable file handling and faster boot times to improved support for large storage volumes and smoother performance under pressure. At the show, you’ll be able to see how NVMe, when properly harnessed, makes RISC OS feel more modern, stable, and capable than ever before.</p>
<p>We’ll have our custom wood panelled ITX cases available to take away. In either 5 litre or 8 litre capacity, these beautiful little cases make your otherwise anonymous systems really stand out. Designed as a DIY kit, they come as both a fully matt acrylic case or one with wooden front and top panels, also adding a two port USB header converter. Ideal for CM4IO based systems.</p>
<p>And if you want a flash but quality keyboard for your RISC OS needs, we’ll have some on sale that will literally flash – if you ask them to!</p>
<p>With individually backlit near silent Cherry Red MX keys, you can emulate the Retro look of an A3000. And with a few keystrokes, an A3010! That’s right, you can colour each individual key to whatever colour you want.</p>
<p>And, of course, we’ve got a couple of other developments we’ve been quietly refining in the background – ideas and innovations that have kept us excited at RISCOSbits HQ, and we can’t wait to share. Maybe even a throwback to 2005, “adjusted” for the modern 32bit world.</p>
<p>We’ll be showing off, for you to order on the day at special Show prices, our ECOS and ECOfile range of companion systems, to enhance your RISC OS experience by using the best of other OSes.</p>
<p>We’ll also have a selection of clearance stock at bargain prices, some lovely stickers and badges, also available at special low prices. Plus a few other decorative items that we’ll share in due course.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a long-time RISC OS veteran or completely new to the scene, the RISC OS London Show is the perfect opportunity to see the latest developments, chat with us, and explore what RISCOSbits has to offer. We’re excited to bring something for everyone—and we look forward to seeing you in Harrow!</p>

      <h1>Fireworkz Pro 2.33.00 released</h1>

(date: 2025-10-19)
      <p>
      <p>We are pleased to announce the release of Fireworkz Pro version 2.33.00 as a free upgrade for existing users of 2.3x series. It is available to download now on !Store – look in your “My Software”.</p>
<p>The new version includes a number of changes including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved load / save performance on modern systems (helpful on SD-based systems)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VerityMono font (included) is used where monospaced fonts are presently used on systems that don’t have DejaVu Mono already present. This improves on-screen presentation especially for older computers or those running vanilla RISC OS 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No longer leaves hourglass on exit (thank goodness!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updates for national holidays dates in 2026 and 2027</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved documentation and example files – updated content, fixed links and extended function examples</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correct handling of 2-colour toolbar sprites</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Built using latest tools for improved SWI performance, but still compatible with older systems</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall this new version should perform faster and look nicer than previous versions, whilst fixing some bugs.</p>
<p>Users who qualify for the update can download now on !Store. We’ll also have CD versions (can be put on USB stick too, but bring your stick as we’ll only have larger ones for sale) at the London Show for people looking for physical copies. Existing users can purchase the CD/physical edition for a very low cost making it an ideal show-trinket, whilst other folks can take advantage of show prices on upgrades/full copies.</p>
<p>Fireworkz Pro 2 is an office suite for RISC OS with word processor, spreadsheet and database facilities. Its spreadsheet elements are particularly strong with Excel import/export. Tabling facilities make it ideal for use with DTP packages like Impression/Ovation with data-driven “live” tables and charts. Web/HTML export is also included as well as PDF facilities.</p>
<p>The software is supplied with several manuals and many examples, tutorials and reference files.</p>
<p>For more information, please look for it on !Store.</p>

      <h1>Live Coding with Gerph, Sunday 19th October at 1pm.</h1>

(date: 2025-10-19)
      <p>
      <p>Mostly good session. The OS_* SWIs were implemented (OS_ReadVarVal and OS_SetVarVal), and seem to be working ok. Error numbers were set properly, and code variables are now implemented. However, they’re only working in 32bit RISC OS. 64bit RISC OS has a different interface, which I’ve implemented, but quite apart from the code variables, I seem to be getting errors back oddly. I suspect that’s CMunge, but I’m not completely sure. I’m investigating.</p>

      <p>If you’re coming to the RISC OS London Show, which at the time of writing will take place in just six days, the organisers have posted an important update for people using public transport: For those planning to travel by tube, note that the Bakerloo Line through Kenton station is closed on the day of the show.

      <p>We were working on a SNES 'Taz' game at Software Creations in about 1993/4 and all that remains of the game are these three Taz sprite frames. That may change if I uncover any other artwork. I believe these were drawn/animated by Andy Wilson ( RIP ). Andy is at the front in the photo.</p>

      <p>Over 40 years ago we played 'Hopper' on the BBC Micro/Acorn Electron and 'Frogger' in the arcades. Today it's become 'Crossy Road' for mobiles and tablets. There was a rumour that 'Hopper' was named after Andy Hopper, a senior employee at Acorn Computers in the early 80s. Very likely a myth!</p>

      <p>This defence of LLMs is really a damning indictment of interface design - the fact that humans have to resort to ML pattern matching to satisfy the arcane requirements of APIs *designed by humans* is caused by the gulf between the conceptual requirement of the author and the bureaucracy of API cruft</p>

      <p>Having recently updated TrainTimes to version 2.07, Kevin Wells has already brought out another new version of his application for checking up on railway timetables and other related information. Version 2.08 sees the addition of ticket office opening times to the station details window. Kevin has also dealt with an oversight in the previous release, whereby he hadn’t taken into account of stations being added, changed, or deleted when allowing station details to be viewed from a sub-menu in the Change Station section of the application. Like many of Kevin’s…</p>

      <p>Sadly, though, they’re not asking everyone for their drinks orders for the day. It’s now a touch under two weeks (or is it a touch over one and a half?) until this year’s London Show, which takes place on the 25th October at the Harrow District Masonic Centre, and it’s time for another exhibitor announcement – this time from RISCOSbits. It seems that the team at RISCOSbits will shortly be taking “an impromptu, badly timed and slightly inconvenient holiday, immediately before the show,” which means there won’t be enough time…</p>

      <p>
      <p>It’s okay. We’re not launching a RISCOSbits Whisky at the show, it’s just your chance to reserve items from our Show Stock.</p>
<p>Due to an impromptu, badly timed and slightly inconvenient holiday, immediately before the show, we’re out of time to take orders to build up pre-ordered machines to be collected on the day.</p>
<p>So to make amends, we’re offering a chance to reserve items for purchase on the day. We’ll have the following items on sale:</p>
<p><strong>VENOM</strong> – premium compact NVMe machine</p>
<p><strong>FAST NVMe</strong> – another excellent premium NVMe machine in a full Mini ITX case</p>
<p><strong>DIY Systems</strong> – we have the ONE, TWO, and THREE systems available to reserve</p>
<p><strong>Chimera</strong> – a multi-headed machine with a special free surprise for the show!</p>
<p><strong>PiRO Qube</strong> – the smallest NVMe machine possible!</p>
<p><strong>eNVy.Me</strong> – a modern, lightning blue NVMe system with a unique case</p>
<p><strong>FASTFIRE</strong> – our speedy SATA machine with multi-disc capabilities. The fastest true multi-disc systems available.</p>
<p>We’ll also have a few late additions to our usual range with bumped up specs. Plus a range of very new things that should signal it’s worth making the case for visiting us at the show. But we’re not putting those up for reserve. You’ll have to coast on over for those.</p>
<p>To reserve your item, drop us an email at <a href="mailto:london2025@riscosbits.co.uk">london2025@riscosbits.co.uk</a> to let us know what you’d like us to hold for you.</p>
<p>Reservations will be made on a first come, first served basis. All we ask is that you collect your reserved items by 1pm on the day so we don’t have to disappoint too many people!</p>

      <p>My train time table application for RISC OS called TrainTimes has had a couple of tweaks making it now version 2.08 New in this version is that it is now possible on the Station Details window to see th eopening times of the ticket office.

      <h1>RPCEmu 0.95 o Fedora KDE 42 is it possible to connect a Joystick</h1>

(date: 2025-10-12)
      <p>
      <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>I wrote USBJoystick, however it is only suitable for ‘native’ RISC OS hardware – not emulators. It talks to the built-in USB stack in RISC OS 5 and maps HID devices to the old Acorn joystick API. So if you had, for example, a Raspberry Pi running RISC OS, then you could plug in a USB controller, and it would ‘just work’.</p>
<p>RPCEmu is a hardware emulator of an Acorn Risc PC. Those machines didn’t come with USB (they pre-date it!). You would need RPCEmu to provide some sort of USB-compatibility-layer, which would let USBJoystick work. Or perhaps with less effort, RPCEmu could emulate the Acorn joystick API using whatever the underlying system (Linux, Windows or macOS) supports.</p>

      <h1>How to set objasm debug options for the Econet module source</h1>

(date: 2025-10-11)
      <p>
      <p>There is a thread over on stardot regarding getting an ADF10 Econet module to work on a UNIPOD, it presents anecdotal evidence that this been done successfully before but evidently lost without trace.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=29655">https://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=29655</a></p>
<p>I have long wondered about that and in a moment of weakness decided to have a look at it.</p>
<p>SO far I have taken the Econet module source from the IOMD build of RISC OS 5 from my RasPi over to a SA RPC with a unipod, and up to date ROOLDDE, where I can build it out of the RISC OS source tree by dropping its make file into amu.</p>
<p>This results in several targets RMs including Econet, EconetSA &amp; EconetD. The EconetSA module works on anther SA RPC with an Acorn AEH60 Econet module, so that’s a good start at any rate.</p>
<p>In the source I can see quite a lot of extra debugging output, particularly around scanning the podules for the right one, an area that I need to rework first. But running EconetD does not result in any debugging output, and nor actually are any of the strings I can see in this code present in the binary.</p>
<p>I have not used objasm before and never explored this mire of macros.</p>
<p>I can see in code section below what appears to be conditional assembly dependent on ‘DebugFindHardware’</p>
<p>FindPoduleLoop</p>
<p>DECS r3</p>
<p>BMI AddressUnknown</p>
<p>[ DebugFindHardware</p>
<p>BREG r3, “Podule_ReadInfo: R3 = &amp;”</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>Push “r10, r11, r14”</p>
<p>MOV r0, #Podule_ReadInfo_SyncBase + Podule_ReadInfo_ID + Podule_ReadInfo_Type</p>
<p>MOV r1, sp</p>
<p>MOV r2, #3*4</p>
<p>SWI XPodule_ReadInfo</p>
<p>Pull “r10, r11, r14”</p>
<p>[ DebugFindHardware</p>
<p>DREG r10, “Synchronous base address = &amp;”</p>
<p>BREG r11, “ID = &amp;”</p>
<p>DREG r14, “Type = &amp;”</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>BVS FindPoduleLoop</p>
<p>BIC r11, r11, #2_101 ; Knock out FIQ/IRQ request bits</p>
<p>TEQ r11, #SimpleType_Econet:SHL:3</p>
<p>BEQ AddressKnown</p>
<p>TEQ r11, #SimpleType_Extended:SHL:3</p>
<p>TEQEQ r14, #ProdType_Econet</p>
<p>BEQ AddressKnown</p>
<p>B FindPoduleLoop</p>
<p>AddressUnknown</p>
<p>LDR r10, =EconetController ; Default for internal hardware</p>
<p>AddressKnown</p>
<p>[ DebugFindHardware</p>
<p>DREG r10, “Address we are using = &amp;”</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>I can see that ‘DebugFindHardware’ appears to be set in this line but I am not making any sense of it:</p>
<p>DebugFindHardware SETL (:LNOT: ReleaseVersion) :LAND: {FALSE}</p>
<p>The make file does not seem to hint at how debug options are set either.</p>
<p>What am I missing here?</p>

      <p>The 'alternative' 6502 mnemonics where letters are added to the standard mnemonic to specify the addressing mode - eg LDAIM 100</p>
<p>This format came about because existing macro assemblers could be easily adapted to support the 6502 processor. MOS, the makers of the 6502, didn't support this format.</p>

      <p>I know I post a lot of stuff about generative AI and how much I dislike it. So for a change I'm going to write this thread in celebration of the many creative people I've had the good fortune of getting to know and interact with over the past couple of years. Real human creators producing real art.</p>

      <h1>Any ARM Debuggers Ported to RO5 ?</h1>

(date: 2025-10-07)
      <p>
      <p>Thanks to David Feugey for allowing me to use a sub-domain on his ‘riscos.fr’ website, I am releasing a 32-bit Risc OS 5 version of !ARM_Debug. Anybody interested can now have a ‘play’.</p>
<p>This is 32-bit version of Theo Van Der Boogaert’s original RO4 standalone debugger and works independently of the DDE (or whatever). It does require RISC OS 5 to run though:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fladda.riscos.fr/">https://www.fladda.riscos.fr/</a></p>
<p>This is a first ‘beta’ release and contains some known bugs and no doubt some unknown bugs. All comments welcome.</p>
<p>I next plan to look at implementing SPSR (SVC and USR) support and possibly some co-processor instruction support (these instructions appear to be used in the RO5 kernel).</p>

      <p>USR in RISC OS nemoBasic acts as a string operator modifier, causing the string(s) to be treated as UTF-8 instead of bytes. This even applies to the comparison operators, which deal sensibly with malformed UTF-8 sequences (as you can never trust input).</p>
<p>(example uses EXP to expand C-style strings)</p>

      <p>MakeDraw has been updated to version 2.84 which increases the maximum number of nested groups to 256 (from 64). It also now ignores draw object types &amp;500, &amp;510, &amp;2020, &amp;2030 and &amp;2032 when a Draw file exported from RiscOSM is the subject of a PROCmdInclude() call. This allows, once again, maps exported from RiscOSM to be included in another Draw file being created.</p>

<p>I’ve just picked the bones out of that other feature and hence this started working correctly. Small victories.</p>

      <h1>Today 3.20 Released</h1>

(date: 2025-10-05)
      <p>
      <p>I’m pleased to announce the release of Today version 3.20. The application lists events that have taken place (or will take place) on a given date. It contains a database of historical information, to which additional dates and personal anniversaries can be added.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/data/software/today/screen1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Originally written by James Miskin, I produced a 32-bit update in 2006. Almost 20 years later, following a question at RISC OS North back in March, I went on a hunt for the source code, dusted it off, and have produced a new version with the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The application has been built with a toolchain known to be ARMv7 compatible.</li>
<li>There is now a Help… entry in the main and iconbar menus.</li>
<li>The date shown in the scan window is updated when the system clock changes day, so long as the window was previously on the current day.</li>
<li>The upper bound for the day of the month is correctly set when opening the event window.</li>
<li>A minimum window size is applied when setting the extent of the scan and search windows, to avoid the search results being hidden.</li>
</ul>
<p>A copy of version 3.20 can be found on my website, at <a href="https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/today">https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/today</a>. It has also been added — finally — to the PlingStore, and if I’ve managed to find the correct incantations it should also show up in PackMan over the next few days.</p>
<p>Originally released into the Public Domain by James, I have applied version 1.2 of the EUPL to the new release to make its status clear, and the source code can finally be found amongst my other projects on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/steve-fryatt/today">https://github.com/steve-fryatt/today</a></p>

      <p>I'm currently working out what to show at next month's Retro Computer Festival ( Gaming Edition ) at the Centre for Computing History. I'm bringing along a Master 128 or BBC Micro and will focus on game development for those machines. Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

(date: 2025-09-30)

      <p>I’m surprised that no one hasn’t had a go at making a RO ROM with Linux tools! – instead of using a Emulator.</p>

      <h1>RPi 500+</h1>

(date: 2025-09-29)
      <p>
      <blockquote>
<p>if your audience would find it easier to do something another way, and you actively choose to do something different… then you are failing your audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we take that statement literally then almost everything in RISC OS, old and new, could be seen as “failing” the audience. For example, people have been asking for easier development environments or multi-core support for years, and those needs are still unmet (and after sponsoring 2.5M GBP they still will be unmet apparently!).</p>
<p>That said, I do think Steve has a point.</p>
<p>If someone wanted to organise an online-only event (say a “RISC OS Xmas online show”), I am sure plenty of us could contribute material. The format would mostly be one-way, with prepared videos or live presentations and only limited feedback.</p>
<p>In-person shows, in contrast, work very differently. From my own experience, I get much more direct feedback and can respond to exactly what people are interested in. It also allows for spontaneous conversations that just do not happen online. On Zoom, only one person can really speak at a time, and asking questions in front of a whole audience may not suit everyone.</p>
<p>For example, at the last Bristol show I attended, I was constantly busy with people asking questions, and once the initial “ice” was broken, I had some really valuable and enjoyable conversations. That kind of interaction is very hard to replicate online.</p>
<p>So to me, the two experiences serve different purposes. Online events are valuable, but they cannot replace in-person shows. Even for those of us doing free software rather than running businesses, I think the in-person format offers something unique.</p>
<p>Hence I don’t think the in-person shows are “failing their audience”, I think they are fine and having only two in-person shows per year seems to be a good number given the slow pass in developments that are happening on RISC OS (it’s an old platform and it takes time to build stuff on it). There might be space for an on-line event for who cannot attend the in-person event.</p>
<p>For what concern discussing users issues, I think user-group meetings are still way more valuable (either in person or on-line), given the focus of such meetings.</p>

      <p>
      <p>Today&#8217;s live coding was very successful.</p>
<ul>
	<li>GSTrans of variables on set now works, meaning that there&#8217;s a distinction between type 0 and type 4 variables.</li>
	<li>EvaluateExpression variables (type 3) are now handled on set.</li>
	<li>Number type variables (type 1) are handled on set.</li>
	<li>A new *-command has been added to allow easier debugging of the variables that have been set.</li>
	<li>Simple tests added to check the type, length and returned values from the SWIs have been added. These are run during the CI.</li>
	<li>Fortify is now present in the build, checking that the memory has all been freed (and the memory leaks have been fixed).</li>
	<li>Release 0.02 has been made and, as usual, the binaries are also in the riscos64-status repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>Missing bits&#8230;</p>

(date: 2025-09-26)
      <p>
      <blockquote>
<p>I can understand the attraction of using pCloud directly from <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. But failing that, if you have a <span class="caps">NAS</span>, it may be poossible to get the <span class="caps">NAS</span> to connect to pCloud, and then use LanMan98 or <span class="caps">NFS</span> to access it from <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS until CloudFS is revived.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually use this approach anyway now. The reality is this approach also boost performance. I let my Linux box do the sync up in the background, while local share is ultra fast like this and has another advantage, as soon as my ShareFS for Linux is completed and working, I&#8217;ll &#8220;re-share&#8221; my pCloud via ShareFS Server, which means pCLoud for old <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 3 on the Archie as well! ;)</p>
<p>So the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS pCloud client is useful only to who has not a 3rd party Linux box in their network.</p>

It's been sat in a cupboard for over 30 years as I have no way of playing it as it requires an NTSC NES/TV setup. Therefore, it has never been played! Mint condition.</p>

      <p>The Wakefield RISC OS Computer Club (WROCC) will be holding their next meeting on Wednesday, 1st October, with Andrew Rawnsley taking centre stage to bring the group up to date with all things R-Comp. Andrew will bring the group up to date with all the latest developments at R-Comp and RCI, and with the London Show (at the time of the meeting) just three and a half weeks away, there’s a chance he may be able to share some details or sneak peaks of new releases for the event.

(date: 2025-09-23)
      <p>
      <p>I’ve taken a couple of embedded projects from ARM32 to AArch64. The biggest time sinks weren’t the compiler, but hidden 32-bit assumptions: pointer math in ints, varargs, packed structs, and unions. Rewriting inline asm and aligning to the AAPCS64 calling convention was unavoidable. What helped most was harsh warnings, UBSan/ASan in tests, and swapping types to size_t/uintptr_t early. For legacy apps we used a small thunk layer and kept a 32-bit build running until parity.</p>

      <p>This is 100% insane. Yes, an employer may stipulate this in your employment contract, but that's because *they* are paying *you* for your time, and so the things you create during your working hours are their IP. The tenant/landlord relationship is in no way comparable!</p>

      <p>So much I agree with here. Games are meant to be enjoyable, and all the more so when you can share your experiences of them with others. Easy mode is my default for new games as it helps me get a feel for them and - sometimes! - even complete them. Difficulty is there for replay only, in my world.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s now a Git repository on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-systemvars">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-systemvars</a>) stub module for SystemVars, which allows simple strings to be stored in a dictionary and retrieved. There are some simple SWIs implemented that allow the interface to be exercised. The module also has CI to ensure that the build and loading of the module is successful &#8211; and there&#8217;s a small test to exercise the internals.</p>
<p>As usual, if anyone has any questions, comments or even code suggestions and PRs, please fire them this way.</p>

      <p>The Sinclair Oxford 300 was launched in 1975 and boasted scientific functions. As with all Sinclair products it was very competitively priced - this one was £29.99, very cheap when compared with similar HP models. It had tiny 7 segment displays and a plastic lens to make them appear much larger.</p>

      <p>BBC Micro 'Alien 8' development disks. I was looking after these for over 35 years on Paul Proctor's behalf. I had great fun trying to archive them during the last few years.

      <h1>RISC OS 64bit work status</h1>

(date: 2025-09-18)
      <p>
      <p>Quick status update on the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 progress, since I posted last&#8230;</p>
<ul>
	<li>The links on the repository have been updated with pages for individual modules, listing the features that those modules need to have and their current status.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;m happy with my implementation of the Debugger module now, and the live coding for that has finished. It&#8217;s not quite as functional as the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac version / the riscos-disassemble Python package, but it&#8217;s working ok for me.</li>
	<li>New `Conversions` module implementation which works.</li>
	<li>Most of the `Convert*` modules have now been built, though not tested in 64bit (they&#8217;re not really important at this stage, but it&#8217;s good to know they build!</li>
	<li>The `IconBorders` modules all build just fine.</li>
	<li>Problems I had with `RemotePrinterSupport` have now been fixed and it builds in 64bit.</li>
	<li>`ResourceFS` stub module is now complete, and obviously doesn&#8217;t do much yet.</li>
	<li>`VideoTTX`, `VideoGuard` and `MimeMap` built for 64bit, although they&#8217;re not tested and probably won&#8217;t quite do what&#8217;s expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>And internally I&#8217;ve been updating my build environment to better handle certain cases that weren&#8217;t working previously.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Build service now has the ability to enable faster builds, using the host version of the tools &#8211; see <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/741270">https://asciinema.org/a/741270</a> for a simple run.</li>
	<li>Improved integration within the SublimeText editor &#8211; pressing command-B can now build things with <span class="caps">AMU</span> locally and highlight the errors inline in the file, or with the build service.</li>
	<li>Improvements to CMunge for 64bit interfaces that weren&#8217;t quite right, and the -zerrors switch, that I had recently broken.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most recent test run says that most of the modules and tools that are present in the repository at least load correctly:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/actions/runs/17814204760">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/actions/runs/…</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The progress for Phase 1 is looking pretty good now, with many components exceeding the original aims for this phase. Still 17 falling short, but they&#8217;re probably going to be reletively easy to get to an appropriate state.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Progress">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Progress</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And the SystemVars module is one of those modules that I will be moving on to in the Live Coding sessions. I suspect this will be relatively easy to deal with, but there will almost certainly be some special cases to handle.</p>
<p>Anyhow that&#8217;s where things are for me. You can always follow the repositories to see what&#8217;s being done.</p>
<p>Again, if anyone wants to contribute to these, please speak up.</p>

      <h1>Developers’ fireside chat – 20th September</h1>

(date: 2025-09-17)
      <p>
      <p>The next friendly fireside chat for people interested in RISC OS software development will take place at 7:30pm on Saturday, 20th September. Taking place online via the Zoom video conferencing service, these meetings are intended as an informal way of allowing RISC OS programmers, and anyone interested in the subject, to get together online to discuss relevant matters. These meetings don’t have a set agenda, and topics discussed are based on the questions people might ask or what they’ve been working on and choose to demonstrate. For example, topics covered…</p>

      <h1>Stations more accessible in TrainTimes 2.07</h1>

(date: 2025-09-17)
      <p>
      <p>A new version of TrainTimes has been released. The program is one from the Kevin Wells family of applications that use Wget to request data from a remote application programmer interface (API). In this case, the program can be used to check train timetables, as well as find out useful information about the trains themselves, the stations along their route, and so on. It does so through two different APIs – Real Train Times (from whom, users will need to register for an API key) and National Rail. The update…</p>

      <p>50 years ago the first 6501 and 6502 CPUs were made available at the WESCON trade show in San Francisco. However, MOS found out they weren't actually allowed to sell anything on the show floor so set up shop in a nearby hotel. Chuck Peddle led the team that created the 650x family of processors.</p>

      <h1>Debugger module release</h1>

(date: 2025-09-16)
      <p>
      <p>Over the course of the last 19 live coding sessions, I have produced a Debugger module which supports many of the things that we expect on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. We support&#8230;</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>*Memory</code></li>
	<li><code>*MemoryI</code></li>
	<li><code>*MemoryA</code></li>
	<li><code>*DumpI</code></li>
	<li><code>*InitStore</code></li>
	<li><code>*ShowRegs</code></li>
	<li><code>*BreakSet</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
	<li><code>*BreakClr</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
	<li><code>*BreakList</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
	<li><code>*Debug</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
	<li><code>*Continue</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_Disassemble</code></li>
	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_DisassembleThumb</code></li>
	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_DisassembleArch</code> (for AArch32 <span class="caps">ARM</span> and Thumb, and for AArch64 instructions)</li>
	<li>AArch32 instructions are disassembled (default for regular <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS), including the <span class="caps">FPA</span> instructions.</li>
	<li>AArch64 instructions are disassembled (default for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
	<li>The module is built and released automatically through CI on GitHub – <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases</a></li>
	<li>There’s a project board to record what needs to be done – <a href="https://github.com/users/gerph/projects/1">https://github.com/users/gerph/projects/1</a></li>
	<li>The module can be built, and runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS.</li>
	<li>The module is tested with test code derived from the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac test suites &#8211; automatically within CI.</li>
</ul>
<p>The module has been demonstrated and run on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS in RPCEmu with !Zap and works as you might expect.</p>
<p>The module can be obtained from the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Debugger GitHub site &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases</a></p>
<hr />
<p>The purpose of the Live Coding sessions was &#8211; initially &#8211; so that I could get some practice at doing coding in a different environment, and demonstrating how some techniques and skills can be used. I was hoping that it would be an encouragement to others that things which seem complicated are largely just a set of small steps to address a problem.</p>
<p>The Debugger module was intended to be a &#8216;simple&#8217; example of how porting something useful to <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS can be done. It wasn&#8217;t quite so simple &#8211; there&#8217;s been work in shell, in python, in perl, and assembler and converting from C99 to C89. And working with someone else&#8217;s code which I didn&#8217;t understand at first. I hope that it has given people some encouragement to try doing things they wouldn&#8217;t have. I hope that it has also shown that mistakes are many and plentiful &#8211; and we roll with them. It&#8217;s also shown how bad my typing is!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been very exciting. I&#8217;ve laughed a lot. And along the way there&#8217;s been a number of people coming into the chat and watching the sessions without knowing anything about <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. People who asked questions &#8211; even if they&#8217;re not on the topic of the debugger &#8211; and have been very friendly. That&#8217;s been a nice experience too.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s been quite successful, and has produced a replacement module in C for an existing module. Feel free to raise bugs in GitHub, and PRs will be happily received if they&#8217;re incremental and reviewable.</p>

(date: 2025-09-16)
      <p>
      <p>This was the final session on the Debugger. I&#8217;m pretty happy with the disassembler now. This final session updated the CI tests so that they (mostly) pass. There were some failures when it was finally integrated into the CI, which I decided to fix offline &#8211; they were caused by the use of a non-deterministic part of the table generation in Python. Now that it&#8217;s fixed, I think we&#8217;ve got a good version.</p>
<p>The Debugger has been published up on the site in the releases section: <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c</a></p>
<p>The 64bit version can be found on the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64bit status pages: <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status</a></p>

<p>Next week, I&#8217;ll be starting on a different project &#8211; something short, I hope!</p>

      <p>You can assemble 68000 code on a BBC Micro if you have the right software. This cross-assembler was published by Crossware in 1986 IIRC. They sold different versions for various 8 and 16-bit processors. The 68K version was the most exotic. Here's a test process going through lots of combinations.</p>

      <p>Setting up an older #RISC_OS 5 system as a freebie for a returning user. It's amazing what you forget:</p>
<p>How slow SD card storage is;
How fast a Pi 3B+ was in its day;
How cool it runs!</p>
<p>It's a good little machine, but it does remind you how far we've come since then.</p>

      <p>There are two applets that I know of for assisting in the creation of an index. Although, it's been many years since I've used either of them so can't give any more detailed help at this time.</p>

      <p>And while on the @riscosopen.bsky.social forum people are posting of using Linux, no resurrect RISCOSE, no something else, no nothing is possible for #RISC_OS is the typical old school mindset, #ProjectMerlin runs now on #AArch64, because if we don't start doing something, nothing will ever happen.</p>

      After years of "make everything monochrome" I note that Android 16 has suddenly decided that colour helps communication. 😲

I wonder how long this fashion cycle will last at Google? Every generation rejects the norms of the previous generation. Bless their rebellious little cotton socks. 🙄

      <p>This is an excellent opportunity to explore professional desktop publishing on RISC OS at no cost, guided by someone with years of experience. RISC OS is open-source and can run natively on the Raspberry Pi 4, Pi 400, and earlier models.</p>

      <h1>Opportunity for a re-think?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-12)
      <p>
      <p>I suppose I should reply to this thread</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My view is that if there is any wider future for “RISC OS”, it’s applying the look and feel to the 64 bit OS and applications that I and millions of others are using on Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of what you desire already exists, or at least a runnable foundation does.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHsHU-dDwAk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHsHU-dDwAk</a></p>
<p>Source code here;<br />
<a href="https://home.marutan.net/hg/riscwm">https://home.marutan.net/hg/riscwm</a></p>
<p>Here are a few pros and cons compared;</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
	<li>Already runs on 64bit (arm, x64, powerpc, whatever)</li>
	<li>Runs Linux <sup id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> apps (technically more easily than <span class="caps">ROLF</span>, as it doesn&#8217;t require apps to be recompiled/linked against a different graphics stack).</li>
	<li>Runs <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS apps, via RPCEmu</li>
	<li>Contributing programmers don&#8217;t need to be able to program an OS, this is an application written in (comparatively) high-level C.</li>
	<li>Large chunks of contributions do not require programming at all, it is often theme and config file tweaking.</li>
	<li>Small enough in scope to not take person-decades of effort.</li>
	<li>Does not require anyone to pay for tools to contribute.</li>
	<li>Not asking for 2.5 million.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
	<li>It&#8217;ll never be able to exactly make all Linux apps look and behave like <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS ones, you can theme, tweak widget libraries, but it will never be 100% perfect.</li>
	<li>It&#8217;s far too easy to look at the project and go &#8220;but that&#8217;s not <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS&#8221; and ignore it completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it finished? Nope, but if this is something you actually want to move forward with you should certainly give it a go and see if it&#8217;s the start you wanted.</p>
<p>Realistically I do not worry about the &#8216;future of <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS&#8217;, there are not enough people left, and everyone has a different idea of what it is. But if you do worry about such things, I would suggest working out how to contribute to your dreams, as we are way past just sitting on the sidelines and hoping the future falls into your lap.</p>
<p><sup id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Technically it is not hard-linked to Linux, you could run it on top of one of the BSDs, Solaris, etc, something with XWindows on</p>

      <p>I can see that makes sense&#8230; the snag is the lack of an equivalent of the &#8216;welcome guide&#8217;. Even the maker&#8217;s webpages don&#8217;t help much and even use different icons to what I see on a new machine! It&#8217;s assumed the owner &#8216;just knows&#8217;.</p>
<p>Yes, I did know that Android has avery different interface because it is used on systems quite unlike a standard desktop machine. But the lack of ad init info has been the problem. Taken me ages to get even the basic functions sorted.</p>

      <p>The next meeting of the RISC OS User Group of London (ROUGOL) will take place on Monday, 15th September, with Gavin Crawford taking the podium to talk about how he uses Ovation Pro in his publishing business. A graphic artist and designer with over forty years experience in the field of printing and publishing, Gavin started out at his family’s printing company in the mid-1980s, at which time artwork was hand-drawn. He introduced BBC Micros for admin tasks, later to be replaced by RISC OS machines, and by the mid-1990s…</p>

Many moons ago (21 years, actually), I uploaded a bunch of stuff to <a href="http://www.lewisgilbert.co.uk">http://www.lewisgilbert.co.uk</a>. Having left it there, unloved and abandoned for a while, I&#8217;ve now put it on my current site <a href="https://www.inglenot.com/archiology/">Inglenot</a> <br />
The other site will die soon, so if anyone is still interested or linked to it, please check out the new site.<br />
Also, if anyone can update the credits &#8211; comp.sys.acorn.networking is still given in the original &#8211; I&#8217;d be grateful<br />

      A Nightmare on Elm Street, seen aged... 7! 😆

It was a school coach trip, lot of older kids (although none of them were 18...) and one of them had it on VHS, passed it to the front and said "sir, let's put this on". Teacher promptly fell asleep and we were all terrorised by Freddy Krueger.

<p>It doesn&#8217;t change anything, and this statement is technically true (it would be trivial to support arm32 binary with Thumb2 <span class="caps">JIT</span>, and vice versa, if you had both JITs available), but it turns out WebKit didn&#8217;t have shims between Thumb and traditional so the -marm or -mthumb2 flag would have actually toggled both the binary and the <span class="caps">JIT</span> (pre-2018). I think that explains the confusion about using -marm to use the ARM32 <span class="caps">JIT</span>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s possibly the reason the preferred <span class="caps">JIT</span> is Thumb (as the binary would have been Thumb), though another could be because condition flags seem barely used in the generated code, meaning it&#8217;s a waste of memory (space and bandwidth) (4 bits per 32-bit instruction wasted, so may as well use 16bit thumb). I imagine they&#8217;re barely used because it&#8217;s a very simple optimiser which works on all supported CPUs (at the time: SH4/<span class="caps">MIPS</span>/ARM32/AArch64/x86).</p>

      <p>Yes. Feel free to try it &#8211; it&#8217;s in the riscos64-status repository.</p>
<p>The CI hasn&#8217;t built it properly since I started introducing the tests, but I try to put a version in that repository after it has been updated. <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/tree/master/rm32">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/tree/master/r…</a> has the 32bit <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS version.</p>
<p>The 64bit version also works too &#8211; you can load that into the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 shell and see it working&#8230;</p>
<p>Go to: <a href="https://shell.riscos.online/static/term64.html">https://shell.riscos.online/static/term64.html</a></p>
<p>Then:</p>
<pre>
*URLCopy <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/raw/refs/heads/master/rm64/Debugger,ffa">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/raw/refs/head…</a> Debugger
*SetType Debugger Module
*RMLoad Debugger
</pre>
<p>and you can use it as you might expect &#8211; as stated breakpoint handling is not defined yet for 64bit.</p>
<p>The demonstration in RPCEmu in episode 11 starts at 2:39:54 so you can see the module being used inside !Zap.</p>
<p>Around here is where I&#8217;m loading up RPCEmu to test the module:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/sb2PBL2QmVA?si=_ezJA1CaClZjbPgW&amp;t=9594">https://www.youtube.com/live/sb2PBL2QmVA?si=_ezJA1CaCl…</a></p>
<p>The module is tested on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac, and I&#8217;ve demonstrated it on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 4. I assume it works on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 5 &#8211; other than the breakpoint handling it&#8217;s not doing anything special, and nobody&#8217;s reported any issues. Then again, nobody&#8217;s actually said they tried it so&#8230; meh&#8230;</p>

However, it didn't claim to be an IBM PC compatible. Launched in late 1981. I recently acquired these manuals, sadly, not the computer!</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>I have a Raspberry Pi 4 and I build a game I wrote, about 40,000 lines of C.<br />
Building from the SD card takes over 10 minutes, without timing it, building from <span class="caps">RAM</span> disk takes maybe a minute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something there doesn&#8217;t quite sound right to me.</p>
<p>Taking <a href="https://gitlab.riscosopen.org/RiscOS/Sources/HWSupport/USB/Controllers/DWCDriver">DWCDriver</a> as an example of a thing which is ~36000 lines of C, I compiled that on a Pi 2 which has a no-name micro SD card from the supermarket and on 3 runs I get</p>
<ul>
	<li>24s</li>
	<li>24s</li>
	<li>25s</li>
</ul>
<p>Those 36000 lines result in 19 object files being written to the card, and looking at the dependencies which are written to the Makefile there are 591 lines, which I interpret as meaning 591 files were <strong>read</strong> in order to <strong>write</strong> 19 object files.</p>
<p>If anything the times would reduce (if bound by processing speed alone, using the same SD card) as a Pi 4 is faster than a Pi 2, so I wonder how the 40000 lines of the game can take 20x longer to build?</p>

$300K they want for it (in the US)! I wouldn't give them £30K. It's 2025 you know. A museum piece and it's never lived.

      <p>We had a VIC 20 at school and I used it a few times, but preferred using the CBM PET. I wanted to know more about the hardware so bought the official Programmer's Reference Manual ( 1982 ). It's a great book that covers the machine really well - it even has a fold-out system schematic. #Commodore</p>

      <h1>intro to RISCOS Development</h1>

(date: 2025-09-03)
      <p>
      <blockquote>
<p>thanks for the list of resources and creating a lot of those by yourself as well – this is impressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My pleasure and I am sure also the guys who helped and <span class="caps">ROOL</span> will be happy to hear all the resources were useful :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there are some toolchains allowing for a great cross-debugging experience (also on-target, I used them for Cortex-M variants) that would streamline the process of doing that adaption moonshot needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed. I am rewriting my own <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS using Rust and I have already reached the stage where I can have live source debugging of the entire kernel and even in tools like VSCode, so in my case (and I am talking about my case only) I don&#8217;t have any limitation coming from <span class="caps">DDE</span> being old limited. But <span class="caps">ROOL</span> is a different beast and I am not associated with them in any form or shape, so no idea what they are planning and how. But I know at least a few of them work in embedded development, so I know they are aware of the modern tools available.</p>
<p>Here is a picture for you:<br />
<img src="https://paolozaino.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-3.png" width="480" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>as far as I know, the <span class="caps">SWI</span> interfacing into module code by using some of the <span class="caps">ARM</span> registers and bank-switching others should translate into a function call in C like it did back in the days with 24bit code, but I assume subtle differences might need addressing (and to overcome) depending on the <span class="caps">ARM</span> core used and depending on the linker.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s already possible to write modules in C and by long time, moreover with the transition to AArch64, they will probably need to embrace an interface like CallASWI which somewhat resemble the mechanism in modern OS used to call proper SysCalls; so I think <span class="caps">ROOL</span> have already addressed this. Given CallASWI is also a mechanism recommended to use on 32bit, it maybe a functional way to make both <span class="caps">ABI</span> and <span class="caps">API</span> feels close and somewhat standardised. But again, I am guessing here, <span class="caps">ROOL</span> is the entity with the details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>would a simulation of a minimal machine as a ‘proof of concept’ and/or starting point would make sense before switching to real hardware, or does this exist already either intendedly or as an existing product like in the riscos on linux approach?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure what you mean here, sorry. As for my work I debug my own <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS (Merlin) using <span class="caps">QEMU</span> (as well as real Raspberry Pis), so I use <span class="caps">QEMU</span> as the simulation for both 32 and 64 bit . It&#8217;s not perfect, but it does a relatively good job.</p>
<p>If I was in charge (and I am not), I&#8217;d recommend to use <span class="caps">GCC</span> and make sure to produce a symbol file so that future <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS can be debugged live and source level using <span class="caps">QEMU</span> and the embedded <span class="caps">GDB</span> server, makes everyone&#8217;s life easier (a looooot easier), and allow also less skilled developers to be able to help.</p>
<p>But people are entitled to their own opinions, so I guess <span class="caps">ROOL</span> at some point will start answering these questions, they are probably catching up with the technical requirements people are posting about here and there.</p>
<p>Anyway if you&#8217;d like to start a specific topic about the 64bit work please feel free to use the dedicated section of the forum:</p>

      <h1>Using OS_UpCall to notify deletion of a file</h1>

(date: 2025-09-03)
      <p>
      <blockquote><blockquote>They said this in the first paragraph:</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes a file in a directory within the image will be deleted because of actions elsewhere in the image</blockquote></p>
<p>Ah, I didn&#8217;t interpret that in that way, then I read the example which I took to mean <code>Image.A.1</code> was being deleted using the Filer yet somehow the UpCall for <code>Image.A.1</code> wasn&#8217;t happening.</p>
<p>Sounds like the image filing system has a &#8220;real&#8221; file <code>Image.A.1</code> then a virtual/symlink type of setup where you want &#8220;fake&#8221; file <code>Image.Mirage.NotReal.A.1</code> to also vanish from the Filer view. All makes sense now!</p>

      <h1>Time for a Qemu port</h1>

(date: 2025-09-02)
      <p>
      <p>The whole porting of RiscOS was started by Jeffrey Lee back in the day when the first BeagleBoard came to life and the raspberry pi did not yet exist. <br />
I responded to a post from Jeffrey when he got stuck with Qemu and needed real hardware that was difficult to come by at the time. <br />
As I had the same idea some weeks earlier, I already had a BeagleBoard available and so Jeffrey, being as fast as he was, flooded me with new progress often daily so that I had enough to do with getting the stuff onto the board and reporting on what worked and what didn&#8217;t. (Initially I wanted to code as well, but did not want to slow down Jeffrey progress so kept to the role of tester).<br />
So there was some Qemu code written by Jeffrey, but the code never reached the command line prompt afaik.</p>

      People who post AI slop creations on LinkedIn love putting the version of the AI slop model or AI slop tool they used in the description; bonus marks for listing multiple. I assume they do this because they've seen citations in books or photographers stating their f-stops and think it's the same.

      <p>Hi I&#8217;m in the process of writing code for the serial ports on the Pinebook Pro. Am I correct in stating that HAL_UARTFeatures should return the capabilities of the specific port and not the current confugured capabilities ? . For example a port can provide hardware <span class="caps">RTS</span>/<span class="caps">CTS</span> control so bit 3 should be set irrespectively of how it is configured.</p>

      <h1>Live Coding with Gerph, Sunday 31st August at 1pm</h1>

(date: 2025-08-31)
      <p>
      <p>Live coding today was quite successful, albeit I spent a lot of time fumbling around tweaking bits to <code>*Memory</code> working right &#8211; which, if I&#8217;d thought a bit more, would have been easier.</p>
<p>Anyhow, comparing against the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac test results, there were a number of changes to tidy the output up and make it more consistent. The results are pretty good. Of the tests we now have a bunch of passes&#8230;</p>
<pre>
-----------
Pass:      20
Fail:      15
Crash:      0
Skip:      36
-----------
Total run:       35
Pass ratio:   57.14 %
Fail ratio:   42.86 %
</pre>
<p>Which means that we&#8217;re quite consistent. These aren&#8217;t automated into the CI yet, so next week, hopefully we can fix a number of them and then automate them to CI.</p>

      <p>There will be an Acorn and BBC User Group (ABUG) event taking place in the Netherlands later this year – the Dutch ABUG 2025, co-sponsored by The Big Ben Club, which will be held from Friday 3rd to Sunday 5th of October at: MFC de Kiekmure,Tesselchadelaan 1,3842 GA Harderwilk,The Netherlands. Anyone who has an interest in the full range of Acorn and related machines (of any native ‘bit’ size) can come along, whether that’s one, two, or all three days – though it will be necessary to book ahead.

(date: 2025-08-30)
      <p>
      <p>The Wakefield RISC OS Computer Club (WROCC) will be holding their next meeting on Wednesday, 3rd September, with a two-part talk from Chis Johns on the subject of RISC OS file storage. In part one, Chris will look at Filecore, the standard format used by RISC OS systems, with an explanation of how it all works, and for the second part he will be looking at the BlockDevices system, an attempt to ‘modernise and modularise’ disc access, covering why it was created, and how it works.

      Sigh. It's a text prediction engine churning out the closest match to the string of tokens you give it in a prompt. It's not a person, it isn't warm or friendly, it doesn't have any capacity for emotion, reflection or understanding. OpenAI need to stop reinforcing this illusory nonsense.

      <h1>OSLib 64 status</h1>

(date: 2025-08-28)
      <p>
      <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>Quick update on the progress with OSLib&#8230; I&#8217;ve mentioned before the work that I&#8217;ve done towards creating the OSLib veneers for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 (and using them for other purposes). These are now complete, I believe &#8211; all the interfaces for OSLib should now be converted properly.</p>
<p>Previously, I&#8217;d not implemented the non- X-variants of the SWIs, and those calls that spilled arguments on to the caller stack were not generated properly. These issues have both now been fixed &#8211; I realised what the &#8216;!&#8217; means on the def file exit parameters, and these are now set up properly. Together with remembering that I&#8217;m working with more registers, the library is now more efficient than previously. Not that that matters really for these calls, but it&#8217;s nice not to use as much stack.</p>

<p>All of which is to say&#8230; yay! I think I have finally got to the bottom of how the OSLib interface definitions work, and the parser is mostly able to handle them (still doesn&#8217;t handle the comments so well&#8230; but there&#8217;s always scope for improvement), and hopefully OSLib will be useable in some real things soon. I built DrawFile with it a little while back, but it crashed badly, so maybe this&#8217;ll help.</p>

      "Polling released in June found that 30% of the US public believe that by 2034 AIs will display subjective experience"

No offence, but considering 37% of the US public are strict creationists [source: 2024 Gallup poll] I don't really feel like that statistic holds a lot of water.

      <p>It&#8217;s only taken me another 10 minutes or so to get the testing code working. It&#8217;s shown up loads of little differences that are really quite interesting to see. And probably really easy to fix.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Many of the *Memory tests show up differences in the case of the hex values that it is decoding (eg we use lower case &#8216;a0&#8217; rather than &#8216;A0&#8217;). Easy to fix.</li>
	<li>The textual representation avoids using top-bit-set characters, displaying them as &#8216;.&#8217; instead of the character. That&#8217;s not a huge problem, and is an easy fix as well.</li>
	<li>The *MemoryI outputs the hex representation and the textual representation in the opposite order to my other Debugger, which makes everything different.</li>
</ul>
<p>So at the end of the run we have&#8230;</p>
<pre>
Pass:       0
Fail:      29
Crash:      0
Skip:      23
</pre>
<p>which isn&#8217;t ideal but almost all of those differences are resolvable.<br />
I&#8217;ll not commit the code, but leave it until next week and we can investigate the test results and fix what&#8217;s needed.</p>

(date: 2025-08-24)
      <p>
      <p>A couple of years ago, Jeroen Vermeulen ported Cherry Bomb to RISC OS, a shoot ’em up – aka a ‘shmup’ according to its original developer, Krystian Majewski – in which you control a ship at the bottom of the screen, and shoot down the incoming waves of alien attackers. The original game was developed as part of a tutorial series on a YouTube channel called Lazy Devs Academy, operated by Krystian, and Jeroen’s aim was to learn from those tutorials. He initially brought Cherry Bomb to RISC OS using…</p>

      I’ve been updating the RISC OS Hourglass API.

• The ability to read the nesting depth; percentage; LEDs; and a bitfield documenting the supported colours, writeable colours and the number of LEDs.

• The ability to enable nested use of Percentage by defining the meaning of “100%” for nested calls.

The box was made by LINPAC, "Tel. Rawcliffe 331-6", which suggests early rather than late 70s.

      <h1>Screen grab websites with Webshot from Kevin Wells</h1>

(date: 2025-08-16)
      <p>
      Kevin Wells has released a new application, called Webshot, which aims to take screen grabs of web pages. However, what it doesn&#8217;t do is simply save the screen (or browser window), which you could achieve anyway using Paint&#8217;s snapshot facility, or a third party application such as Snapper. Instead, you give it the address of the page you want a snapshot of, and using Wget, Webshot sends that information off to the application programmer interface of a website called Screenshot API, and what the site feeds back is an image&#8230;

      <p>I see people still confusing concurrent and parallel tasks, they are not the same. I think one source of &quot;misinformation&quot; is the original OS multitasking design, a timeshare of a single CPU. Probably that is what's confusing. The term MT used on books describing a concurrent tasks scheduler.</p>

      <p>Good video from @davefarley77.bsky.social about vibe coding. I am extremely skeptical about vibe coding TBH, I cannot see an AI being able to produce code out of a &quot;thin&quot; spec, but even in the case it could, the nature of SWE and incrementalism will collide badly with the way current GenAI works.</p>

      Well, in the context of ROUGOL, anyway. If you regularly attend the RISC OS User Group of London (ROUGOL) meetings &#8211; whether in person or online &#8211; you&#8217;ll know when the meetings will take place each month; it&#8217;s easy enough to remember, being &#8211; unless circumstances force a change &#8211; the third Monday of each month, with December often being an exception because of the proximity to Christmas. What you usually won&#8217;t know until much closer to each meeting day, though, it&#8217;s what the meeting subject will be. Well, for&#8230;

      An occasional reminder: Don't use SJP for anything. They "miscalculated" my father's investments for years; tried to fob him off with a box of wine before a lengthy battle resulted in an £8K settlement; sent him a "wealth report" without numbers, withholding how much money he had for 20 months.

      Please everyone, do NOT send me private messages. There is a bug in @bsky.app right now due to age verification. They forgot to allow us to disable private messages. So your messages won't be read. My apologies on behalf of the Bsky team who has still to catchup on the issue I think.

      Started sorting out my home computer library yesterday. Some of these old books are becoming harder to find at a sensible price. I have a huge stack of computer magazines too which are slowly being organised. Fabulous reference and so interesting to read today. Technology has come a long, long way!

(date: 2025-08-05)
      <p>
      <p>In 1994, Acorn Computers, through its Online Media division, played a central role in one of the earliest practical demonstrations of video-on-demand over a broadband network. The Cambridge (UK) Digital Interactive Television Trial, developed in collaboration with Anglia Television, Cambridge Cable (now Virgin Media), and Advanced Telecommunication Modules Ltd (ATML), anticipated many of the features that would later become standard in streaming media.</p>

      When will a technology company finally invent an algorithm, AI or supercomputer powerful enough to correct American misspellings back to English? 🙄

My tolerance for undoubled consonants is diminishing at an alarming rate.

I have a hardwired prompt in Gemini: I am British, spell English correctly.

      The next friendly fireside chat for people interested in RISC OS software development will take place at 7:30pm on Saturday, 9th August. Taking place online via the Zoom video conferencing service, these meetings are intended as an informal way of allowing RISC OS programmers, and anyone interested in the subject, to get together online to discuss relevant matters. With no specific topic planned, discussions are steered by what people bring up, so that could be their current works-in-progress, development of RISC OS itself, the tools available, and so on –&#8230;

A fact that I'd forgotten is that Mike Follin wrote the 68000 music driver for his bother Tim who did the music for the game.

      Last year I took some old friends to the Northwest Computer Museum. We don't see each other very often, but it seemed like only yesterday that we were developing BBC Micro games. Whilst we were there we played a few of our old games. Here's Andrew Farrow and Paul Proctor enjoying Galaforce 2.

      I kid you not when I say this was my first attempt at the loading screen for Galaforce on the BBC Micro. It demonstrates why most programmers should NOT attempt to do graphics themselves. Fortunately, my schoolfriend Paul Proctor came to the rescue and produced a much better screen for me!

      My Borland Turbo Assembler install disks - from around 1993. Before 'C' took over, many PC applications, tools and games were written in assembly language - 80x86. By 1996, almost everything was written using C/C++. The compilers were more efficient and robust by this time.

      Great to see the ZX Spectrum Next Issue 3 Kickstarter being fully funded in a matter of minutes. I was tempted to get one, but can't justify £300ish on something that I'll probably not have time to use. Don't get me wrong, the £300 price tag is good value, but only if you are going to use it lots!

      If you&#8217;re on certain social media websites, you may have noticed a couple of polls run by RISCOSbits recently. These formed a part of the company&#8217;s research and development, as they decided exactly which direction to take for some new kit that was in the works &#8211; and that new hardware can now be revealed: There are two shiny new toys in the range, both of which are &#8216;companion&#8217; systems designed to work alongside existing RISC OS computers &#8211; with one version of one of the two machines actually intended&#8230;

      Here are some of the level 'script' files for NES Silver Surfer. These control the spawning and behaviour of the objects within the levels. This example is taken from Firelord Horizontal. It uses a simple programming language that is interpreted at runtime. These were manually typed in - no editor!

      August, 1985, and 'The Micro User' magazine published my file recovery program for the BBC Micro. If you accidentally deleted a BASIC file from your disk you could use this utility to recover your program. Written in BBC BASIC and 6502 machine code. 40 years ago!

      Software Creations had a development studio off Cheetham Hill Road, Manchester, where many of our SNES, Genesis and N64 titles were created between 1992 and 1997. Here's what it looks like now, compared with back in 1993. It's lunchtime and everyone is heading off into town for some food and drink!

      The Gold Plated BBC Micro auction has ended - item no longer available.
My guess is that it was a standard Oak case, new and sealed in the box that the owner never used. Perhaps the seller ( who aquired it from the original owner ) googled Oak cased BBC Micro and the Gold-plated one popped up first

      Someone is trying to sell a Gold Plated BBC Micro on eBay - the one given away as a prize by The Micro User. This is in the Science Museum, London AFAIK - and they've used a picture of it. They are claiming to have a brand new, sealed one that they've had since the mid-80s. Why am I suspicious?

If we want to run an Ultima App in the desktop we just use the `--mt` option in the command line, everything else is handled by Ultima itself:👇

Like a lot of Kevin&#8217;s software, Web2PDF makes use of Wget to relay information input into the program&#8217;s RISC OS window to the remote API, and then feed the results back to the user. Usually those results are presented to the user via the application itself, but this time there is a subtle difference. The remote API used by&#8230;

      My XBox bootable demo of the un-released 'The Invincible Iron Man' game from 15th October 2003. It used totally new tech, nothing taken from X2: Wolverine's Revenge. We worked on this game for about 6 or 7 months IIRC and then the game was cancelled and we all lost our jobs.

      On Sunday this week, I'm thinking of tidying up some of the code that isn't quite working right, and making the Debugger build for 64-bit. It probably will hit a few problems, but I expect it to be relatively doable.

      <p>Back in March the <a href="/news/articles/2025/03/28/moonshots-initiative-to-secure-the-future-of-the-os">Moonshots Initiative</a> outlined an ambitious plan to migrate the source code of RISC OS away from hand crafted assembler to reach a 64-bit destination before all the 32-bit chips run out. Already the initiative has generated a number of people asking to be involved, promising leads in the areas of focus, and we’re grateful to have received some <a href="/bounty/polls/45">financial donations</a> from the community already.</p>

      <p>Why not pop along to the Big Ben Club’s annual day in the Netherlands?</p>
<p>The show is on the 10th May 2025 from 10am to 4pm and is located in Koog aan de Zann. It’s <a href="https://www.bigbenclub.nl/rox/info/">easy to reach</a> being only a short distance north of Amsterdam by car, public transport, or even by bicycle.</p>
<p><img src="/images/risc_os_open/shows/rox2025banner.png" alt="Banner logo"></p>
<p>RISC OS Open will be travelling to the Netherlands, equivalent to 0.106% of the <a href="/news/articles/2025/03/28/moonshots-initiative-to-secure-the-future-of-the-os">distance to the moon</a>, and expanding on 2022’s <a href="https://youtu.be/nbtVklhO_Pk?si=A21IEa2uB5dWaq7a&amp;t=1642">theatre topic</a> of the path to 64 bit.</p>

      <h1>&quot;Moonshots&quot; Initiative to Secure the Future of the OS</h1>

(date: 2025-03-28)
      <p>
      <p>Cambridge, UK – 28-Mar-2025 – RISC OS Open Limited (ROOL) is calling on the global technology community to support a bold new initiative to secure the long-term future of RISC OS. The company today announced the launch of its Moonshots programme – a strategic shift away from incremental development, towards large-scale engineering efforts aimed at modernising the operating system for next-generation Arm architectures.</p>
<p><img src="/images/risc_os_open/moonshot-logo-sm-black-transparent.png" alt="Moonshot logo"></p>
<p>RISC OS, originally developed alongside the first Arm chips in Cambridge, remains a uniquely simple and efficient desktop operating system. It has found renewed interest in recent years thanks to its availability on the Raspberry Pi and its open-source licensing model. However, the platform now faces an existential challenge.</p>
