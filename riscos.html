      <h1>How to Purchase DiskKnight ?</h1>

(date: 2025-09-23)
      <p>
      <p>I have not yet purchased any software using the !Store application to date.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I used my Pi3 with Risc OS 5.30 to (attempt to) purchase DiscKnight using the supplied PlingStore application. I&#8217;ve now waited over 24 hours and nothing appears to have happened &#8211; the message on PlingStore still reports &#8220;Payment Being Processed&#8221;. How long should I expect to wait ? Is PlingStore broken or did I do something wrong ?</p>
<p>In the days of 24 hour on-line shopping people expect the purchase of software to be more-or-less instant. Or at least expect some sort of email acknowledgement of their order within 24 hours ??</p>
<p>Or should I be contacting Druck directly and paying direct via PayPal ?</p>

      <h1>Problem reading a USB drive</h1>

(date: 2025-09-23)
      <p>
      <p>We have a device called a Sunny Beam which reads data from an inverter connected to our solar panel installation. This has a <span class="caps">USB</span> connector which gives access to data files in <span class="caps">CSV</span> form. Under Raspbian/Linux/Windows this appears as two normal <span class="caps">USB</span> drives.<br />
But I can&#8217;t access the files under <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. The device mounts OK, with two <span class="caps">USB</span> icons on the iconbar, but the discs are reported as unformatted.<br />
It&#8217;s an old device (from 2012), so I&#8217;m a bit surprised <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS has problems. Under Raspbian, here&#8217;s the device info:</p>
<p><code>
pi@workpi:~ $ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 223.6G  0 disk
|-sda1   8:1    0   256M  0 part /boot
`-sda2   8:2    0 223.3G  0 part /
sdb      8:16   1   3.4M  1 disk /media/pi/SBEAM
sdc      8:32   1   1.6M  0 disk /media/pi/UPDATE
pi@workpi:~ $ sudo blkid /dev/sdb
/dev/sdb: SEC_TYPE="msdos" LABEL="SBEAM" UUID="0123-4567" TYPE="vfat"
pi@workpi:~ $ sudo blkid /dev/sdc
/dev/sdc: SEC_TYPE="msdos" LABEL="UPDATE" UUID="0123-4567" TYPE="vfat"</p>
<p></code></p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="caps">SBEAM</span>&#8221; is the one I&#8217;m interested in. Is &#8220;vfat&#8221; not supported? Or is it something to do with partitions?<br />
4te2 running <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 5.31.<br />
NB: I&#8217;m damned if I can get this &#8220;Textile&#8221; formatting to work &#8230; sorry.</p>

      Absolute joy watching this one from CRD, especially when he gets into the interactive whiteboard! Our school had a grant to go out and buy a bunch of these things, and they ended up in classrooms not getting used much but were very impressive on school open days...

      <h1>Norcroft 64</h1>

(date: 2025-09-23)
      <p>
      <p>I’ve taken a couple of embedded projects from ARM32 to AArch64. The biggest time sinks weren’t the compiler, but hidden 32-bit assumptions: pointer math in ints, varargs, packed structs, and unions. Rewriting inline asm and aligning to the AAPCS64 calling convention was unavoidable. What helped most was harsh warnings, UBSan/ASan in tests, and swapping types to size_t/uintptr_t early. For legacy apps we used a small thunk layer and kept a 32-bit build running until parity.</p>

      This is 100% insane. Yes, an employer may stipulate this in your employment contract, but that's because *they* are paying *you* for your time, and so the things you create during your working hours are their IP. The tenant/landlord relationship is in no way comparable!

(date: 2025-09-22)
      <p>
      <p>It&#8217;s all gone rather quiet on the CloudFS front &#8211; presumably the pCloud developers remain unwilling to accomodate Sprow&#8217;s suggested fixes?</p>
<p>I only ask because my main reason for adopting pCloud in the first place (as opposed to following the way of all flesh into the embrace of Google/iCloud/Onedrive (delete as appropriate) was that pCloud was directly accessible from <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS via CloudFS. If this is no longer likely to be restored, the appeal of pCloud diminishes considerably.</p>

      I've just been looking through the SNES Music demo ROM I worked on at Software Creations and wanted to share some interesting facts about the music in PLOK!

The audio samples total 50K ( Bytes )
The SPC-700 music driver is 8K
Each level tune is between 2K and 4K
The sound effects use 4K.

Amazing!

      So much I agree with here. Games are meant to be enjoyable, and all the more so when you can share your experiences of them with others. Easy mode is my default for new games as it helps me get a feel for them and - sometimes! - even complete them. Difficulty is there for replay only, in my world.

      <h1>Live Coding with Gerph, Sunday 21st September at 1pm.</h1>

(date: 2025-09-21)
      <p>
      <p>Live coding today was another success&#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s now a Git repository on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-systemvars">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-systemvars</a>) stub module for SystemVars, which allows simple strings to be stored in a dictionary and retrieved. There are some simple SWIs implemented that allow the interface to be exercised. The module also has CI to ensure that the build and loading of the module is successful &#8211; and there&#8217;s a small test to exercise the internals.</p>
<p>As usual, if anyone has any questions, comments or even code suggestions and PRs, please fire them this way.</p>

      The Sinclair Oxford 300 was launched in 1975 and boasted scientific functions. As with all Sinclair products it was very competitively priced - this one was £29.99, very cheap when compared with similar HP models. It had tiny 7 segment displays and a plastic lens to make them appear much larger.

      The Liverpool Software Gazette lasted for only 8 issues with the first appearing in November 1979 and the last in February 1981. Published by Microdigital Ltd., it covered all of the home computers of its time. Sadly, the owners sold it to Apple magazine who changed it to Apple only content!

      BBC Micro 'Alien 8' development disks. I was looking after these for over 35 years on Paul Proctor's behalf. I had great fun trying to archive them during the last few years. At first some of them just wouldn't read at all. After lots of cleaning and re-tries I managed to recover the contents.

      So, following on from yesterday's post. It's back to being another rainy day here in Cumbria – well, I guess it's not called the 'Lake' district for nothing.

But even through the wind and the rain, the beauty of this place is apparent.

      It's finally stopped raining here in the Lake District, and the sun is shining. The river level has dropped from what it was yesterday – still flowing through at a fair pace though.

It's so nice to step out of the back door of our studio and take in the tranquil scenery and enjoy a moment of calm.

      Another new find. An invoice from Martin Galway for the Galaforce 2 music and sound effects - BBC Micro  / Acorn Electron. Dated 2nd October 1988. It cost me £115 incl. VAT which was a great deal - mates rates! He wrote a brand new music driver ( player ) for this game and did an amazing job!

Taking place online via the Zoom video conferencing service, these meetings are intended as an informal way of allowing RISC OS programmers, and anyone interested in the subject, to get together online to discuss relevant matters. These meetings don&#8217;t have a set agenda, and topics discussed are based on the questions people might ask or what they&#8217;ve been working on and choose to demonstrate. For example, topics covered&#8230;

      <h1>Stations more accessible in TrainTimes 2.07</h1>

(date: 2025-09-17)
      <p>
      A new version of TrainTimes has been released. The program is one from the Kevin Wells family of applications that use Wget to request data from a remote application programmer interface (API). In this case, the program can be used to check train timetables, as well as find out useful information about the trains themselves, the stations along their route, and so on. It does so through two different APIs &#8211; Real Train Times (from whom, users will need to register for an API key) and National Rail. The update&#8230;

      Tatung Einstein host development system for creating ZX Spectrum, C64 and Amstrad CPC games. Originally developed by Mike Webb and re-created from scratch by @breakintoprogram.co.uk. Software Creations and other North West based companies used this system to develop their titles during the mid-80s.

      50 years ago the first 6501 and 6502 CPUs were made available at the WESCON trade show in San Francisco. However, MOS found out they weren't actually allowed to sell anything on the show floor so set up shop in a nearby hotel. Chuck Peddle led the team that created the 650x family of processors.

      You can assemble 68000 code on a BBC Micro if you have the right software. This cross-assembler was published by Crossware in 1986 IIRC. They sold different versions for various 8 and 16-bit processors. The 68K version was the most exotic. Here's a test process going through lots of combinations.

      NES game development on a Commodore 128. At Software Creations we used C128s for some of our early NES games - Solstice, Fast Break, World Games. The C128 based development system hardware and software was written by Mike Webb. This video shows me loading up the NES Magic Johnson's Fast Break code.

      Setting up an older #RISC_OS 5 system as a freebie for a returning user. It's amazing what you forget:

How slow SD card storage is;
How fast a Pi 3B+ was in its day;
How cool it runs!

It's a good little machine, but it does remind you how far we've come since then.

      This is an excellent opportunity to explore professional desktop publishing on RISC OS at no cost, guided by someone with years of experience. RISC OS is open-source and can run natively on the Raspberry Pi 4, Pi 400, and earlier models.

      <p>
      The next meeting of the RISC OS User Group of London (ROUGOL) will take place on Monday, 15th September, with Gavin Crawford taking the podium to talk about how he uses Ovation Pro in his publishing business. A graphic artist and designer with over forty years experience in the field of printing and publishing, Gavin started out at his family&#8217;s printing company in the mid-1980s, at which time artwork was hand-drawn. He introduced BBC Micros for admin tasks, later to be replaced by RISC OS machines, and by the mid-1990s&#8230;

      A few old business cards I found in a box. The three on the right are from my Software Creations days when we were working on NES Solstice and SNES Equinox. Sony published both titles. The SCEE ones on the left are from much later when I was looking for a new job!

      A Nightmare on Elm Street, seen aged... 7! 😆

It was a school coach trip, lot of older kids (although none of them were 18...) and one of them had it on VHS, passed it to the front and said "sir, let's put this on". Teacher promptly fell asleep and we were all terrorised by Freddy Krueger.

      Fascinating accuracy test of 6502 emulators... in the form of official Nintendo NES emulations.

(Including the one that accidentally implements the R65C19's JSR instead of 6502's! Oops 🤪)

      Random find on some old development disks. Original artwork used in the Amiga version of Sly Spy : Secret Agent - probably also used on the Atari ST. Arcade conversion to home computers by Software Creations. I believe this artwork was taken from the arcade version and adapted by Andrew Threlfall.

      An update has been released by Kevin Wells to one of his newest applications, Web2PDF. The purpose of the software is to convert web pages to PDF files, which can then be opened by any PDF reader you have available. It does this by sending the address of the page, using Wget, to a remote application programmer interface (API) provided by API Layer for the purpose, called Web Page to PDF. The API then feeds back a PDF file which shows the contents of the web page, which can either&#8230;

      Here's the BBC Micro version of Ultimate Play The Game's 'Nightshade' assembling from source code. This was recovered from Paul Proctor's original development disks. It uses BBC BASIC's built-in assembler to generate the executable. From a time when games were all written in machine code. #6502

      An interesting spider find in the house - UK. Not as big as the house spiders that are around at the moment. It's a Noble False Widow. Apparently they can give you a nasty bite, similar to a wasp or bee sting - or a much worse reaction for some people. I took this one to the end of the garden.

      The ACT Sirius 1 (Victor 9000) was designed by Chuck Peddle, father of the CBM PET. It featured a 5MHz 8088 CPU and 128KB of RAM and ran both CP/M-86 and MS-DOS. However, it didn't claim to be an IBM PC compatible. Launched in late 1981. I recently acquired these manuals, sadly, not the computer!

      We had a VIC 20 at school and I used it a few times, but preferred using the CBM PET. I wanted to know more about the hardware so bought the official Programmer's Reference Manual ( 1982 ). It's a great book that covers the machine really well - it even has a fold-out system schematic. #Commodore

      A couple of years ago, Jeroen Vermeulen ported Cherry Bomb to RISC OS, a shoot &#8217;em up &#8211; aka a &#8216;shmup&#8217; according to its original developer, Krystian Majewski &#8211; in which you control a ship at the bottom of the screen, and shoot down the incoming waves of alien attackers. The original game was developed as part of a tutorial series on a YouTube channel called Lazy Devs Academy, operated by Krystian, and Jeroen&#8217;s aim was to learn from those tutorials. He initially brought Cherry Bomb to RISC OS using&#8230;

(date: 2025-08-16)
      <p>
      Kevin Wells has released a new application, called Webshot, which aims to take screen grabs of web pages. However, what it doesn&#8217;t do is simply save the screen (or browser window), which you could achieve anyway using Paint&#8217;s snapshot facility, or a third party application such as Snapper. Instead, you give it the address of the page you want a snapshot of, and using Wget, Webshot sends that information off to the application programmer interface of a website called Screenshot API, and what the site feeds back is an image&#8230;

      I see people still confusing concurrent and parallel tasks, they are not the same. I think one source of "misinformation" is the original OS multitasking design, a timeshare of a single CPU. Probably that is what's confusing. The term MT used on books describing a concurrent tasks scheduler.

      Good video from @davefarley77.bsky.social about vibe coding. I am extremely skeptical about vibe coding TBH, I cannot see an AI being able to produce code out of a "thin" spec, but even in the case it could, the nature of SWE and incrementalism will collide badly with the way current GenAI works.

      I used an Epson FX-80 printer every day when I worked at 'The Micro User' magazine. It was a great workhorse, so I couldn't resist this cheap one when it came up for sale. Not had chance to check it out yet, but was surpised to see an Electrical Safety sticker on it which has only just expired!

      Well, in the context of ROUGOL, anyway. If you regularly attend the RISC OS User Group of London (ROUGOL) meetings &#8211; whether in person or online &#8211; you&#8217;ll know when the meetings will take place each month; it&#8217;s easy enough to remember, being &#8211; unless circumstances force a change &#8211; the third Monday of each month, with December often being an exception because of the proximity to Christmas. What you usually won&#8217;t know until much closer to each meeting day, though, it&#8217;s what the meeting subject will be. Well, for&#8230;

      Please everyone, do NOT send me private messages. There is a bug in @bsky.app right now due to age verification. They forgot to allow us to disable private messages. So your messages won't be read. My apologies on behalf of the Bsky team who has still to catchup on the issue I think.

      Started sorting out my home computer library yesterday. Some of these old books are becoming harder to find at a sensible price. I have a huge stack of computer magazines too which are slowly being organised. Fabulous reference and so interesting to read today. Technology has come a long, long way!

      <h1>Streaming Video in 1994?</h1>

(date: 2025-08-05)
      <p>
      <p>In 1994, Acorn Computers, through its Online Media division, played a central role in one of the earliest practical demonstrations of video-on-demand over a broadband network. The Cambridge (UK) Digital Interactive Television Trial, developed in collaboration with Anglia Television, Cambridge Cable (now Virgin Media), and Advanced Telecommunication Modules Ltd (<span class="caps">ATML</span>), anticipated many of the features that would later become standard in streaming media.</p>

A fact that I'd forgotten is that Mike Follin wrote the 68000 music driver for his bother Tim who did the music for the game.

      ECOS11 is a new Windows #Companion for #riscosfast and  ITX cases to integrate #RISC_OS and Windows into a single system.

But it isn't just a sidekick to FAST, it can also fly solo whilst working in formation with #RISC_OS!

      RISCOSbits upgrades FAST ROM image

https://www.iconbar.com/articles/RISCOSbits_upgrades_FAST_ROM_image/index2203.html

One of the attractions of the FAST systems is the fact that you can update the system. It still needs a custom build but luckily RISCOSbits provides up to 4 custom builds a year. The latest has just been released!

(date: 2025-03-28)
      <p>
      <p>Cambridge, UK – 28-Mar-2025 – <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Open Limited (<span class="caps">ROOL</span>) is calling on the global technology community to support a bold new initiative to secure the long-term future of <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. The company today announced the launch of its Moonshots programme &#8211; a strategic shift away from incremental development, towards large-scale engineering efforts aimed at modernising the operating system for next-generation Arm architectures.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="caps">RISC</span> OS, originally developed alongside the first Arm chips in Cambridge, remains a uniquely simple and efficient desktop operating system. It has found renewed interest in recent years thanks to its availability on the Raspberry Pi and its open-source licensing model. However, the platform now faces an existential challenge.</p>

      <p>You may have blinked and missed a few application updates over the last few months as they scroll past on the <a href="/viewer/events">Recent changes</a> section of the home page. Don&#8217;t worry though! We&#8217;ve been keeping a watchful eye and, skipping over the smaller fixes for now, can bring you the main highlights.</p>

      Q for @dannyrobins.bsky.social re. the visuals in the TV episodes - do the witnesses have chance to sign these off to confirm that they are a fair representation of what they perceived, or are they more an artist's impression?

(Incredible episode last night btw - I feel so sorry for Julian!)

      I have released a new application for RISC OS called PhoneVal which is an international phone number validation application. Once a phone number has been entered and the country selected the application will give some basic information about that number, which can be saved as either a plain text file or as an HTML file. &#8230; <a href="https://kevsoft.wordpress.com/2025/02/05/new-application-phoneval/" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "New Application PhoneVal"</span></a>
