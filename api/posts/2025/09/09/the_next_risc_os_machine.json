  "content": "\n# The Next RIC OS Machine\n\nBy Rabbit in my backyard\n\nI am determined to build another RISC OS Machine based on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. In an ideal world I'd build a machine with standard sized plugs for HTML, USB-C power and USB-2 Keyboard and Mouse connectivity. With the Argon40 pod case off the list I'm going have to accept clunky adapters, the Fubar Orange Troll Baby be dammed.\n\nThe PiShop.us seems to have things in stock. I've put together the [shopping list](https://www.pishop.us/wishlist.php?publicwishlist=45970894-4100-47d3-bf7e-c1a48f0fa889). Now to save my pennies.\n\nThe blank Official Rasperry Pi 32Gig SD Card is going to get RISC OS 5.31v3 from RISC OS Direct. It seems stable in my current testing. Hopefully I'll be able to build and had off a few more of these puppies.\n\n",
