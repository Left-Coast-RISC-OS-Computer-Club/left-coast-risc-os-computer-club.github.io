The talk I find very informative was Steve Revill's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyp5tvEoOaw&list=PLdbtoCQ_z-HFgLf7GUliPGIX5CNSTk97B&index=3) outlining what RISC Open Ltd is up time, the work done on BBC Basic implemented in C and importantly what maybe coming next year in the upcoming stable RISC OS 5.32 release planned for 2026.\n\nThe Highlights for goals RISC OS 5.32 include\n\n- New user setup wizard (goal to make it easier to for people new to RISC OS)\n- Updated Paint\n- BASIC rewritten in C\n- Iconbar flip (configurable in the setup wizard)\n  - this would allow flip where drives versus applications are show\n  - makes a little more similar to other OS taskbar layouts\n- Light and Dark themes\n- Password reveal button for password prompts\n\n",
