# News from the RISC OS London Show 2025

You can find Leo White's coverage of the RISC OS London Show 2025 on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdbtoCQ_z-HFgLf7GUliPGIX5CNSTk97B).  The talk I find very informative was Steve Revill's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wyp5tvEoOaw&list=PLdbtoCQ_z-HFgLf7GUliPGIX5CNSTk97B&index=3) outlining what RISC Open Ltd is up time, the work done on BBC Basic implemented in C and importantly what maybe coming next year in the upcoming stable RISC OS 5.32 release planned for 2026.

The Highlights for goals RISC OS 5.32 include

- New user setup wizard (goal to make it easier to for people new to RISC OS)
- Updated Paint
- BASIC rewritten in C
- Iconbar flip (configurable in the setup wizard)
  - this would allow flip where drives versus applications are show
  - makes a little more similar to other OS taskbar layouts
- Light and Dark themes
- Password reveal button for password prompts
