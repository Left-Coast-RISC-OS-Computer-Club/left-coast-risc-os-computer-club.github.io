# The Next RISC OS Machine

By Rabbit in my backyard

I am determined to build another RISC OS Machine based on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. In an ideal world I'd build a machine with standard sized plugs for HDMI, USB-C power and USB-2 Keyboard and Mouse connectivity. With the Argon40 pod case off the list I'm going have to accept clunky adapters, the Feckless Orange Troll Baby be dammed.

The PiShop.us seems to have things in stock. I've put together the [shopping list](https://www.pishop.us/wishlist.php?publicwishlist=45970894-4100-47d3-bf7e-c1a48f0fa889). Now to save my pennies.

The blank Official Raspberry Pi 32Gig SD Card is going to get RISC OS 5.31v3 from RISC OS Direct. It seems stable in my current testing. Hopefully I'll be able to build and had off a few more of these puppies.
