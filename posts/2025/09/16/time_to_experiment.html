      <h1>Time to experiment with the next machine</h1>
      <p>Rabbit in my backyard, 2025-09-16</p>
      <p>The Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and parts arrived yesterday. I assembled &quot;the next machine&quot; in about five minutes. It took me a long time because I had to find the micro SD card I had previously made for the machine. The parts I ordered from PiShop.us are shared <a href="https://www.pishop.us/wishlist.php?action=viewwishlistitems&amp;wishlistid=11716">here</a>. The thickness of the little RISC OS Machine is the thickness of the USB and HDMI cables that plug into it. It's thin.  My concern now with this implementation is that it is so thin it is easy to get lost. If you stuck it under a mouse pad you wouldn't find it!</p>
      <p>Like the three previous RISC OS Machines I built using the Pi Zero 2W boots quick. Using the RISC OS directory release that includes the improved network stack makes things easier. Now it's time to find another people to give a RISC OS machine to so the club and increase membership 25%.  The eligible individuals know where to find the Rabbit in my backyard.</p>
      <p>One difference from the larger cases I used from Argon40 in additional to non-standard plugs of the Zero is the SD card is completely enclosed by the case. This is useful if you're carrying a spare RISC OS machine in your pocket. The SD card cannot fall out. On the other hand you can to open the case, pull out the Zero to change the SD card. Life is full of compromises.</p>
