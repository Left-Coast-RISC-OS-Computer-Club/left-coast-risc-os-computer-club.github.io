      <source:markdown>Midland User Group (MUG) – 20th anniversary celebration.

On Wednesday 4th February 2026 MUG will be celebrating 20 years since the first meeting of some RISC OS enthusiasts was held in Robin Edwards home in Blackwell.

These included, in addition to Robin Edwards, Dr Pete Borcherds, John Rickman, Doug Webb, David Mullard and Chris Dale.

At that first meeting it was decided to set up MUG and to to hold meetings every other month of the year.

The group quickly expanded to hold meetings at the Methodist Hall in Blackwell.

At the end of 2006, MUG helped the ARM Club with its Christmas show at Featherstone.

Over the course of the last 20 years MUG have held some 16 RISC OS based shows, including that first one, at various venues.

These include the first show run entirely by the club at the Heritage Motor Centre in Gaydon in 2007.

MUG shows have also been held at Birmingham University Guild of Student 2008 – 2009, Kenilworth 2010 – 2014, at the Recursion Fairs 2015-2018, virtually from 2022-July 2023 and the last, to date, in person MUGRISC OS Xmas Market in December 2023.

In addition to those events many MUG members have been regular trippers to the other RISC OS shows that have been held around the UK over the years.

MUG would like to thank members past and present, remember those who are no longer with us, and to thank the many RISC OS related companies and individuals that have made the last 20 years of RISC OS so memorable.

To commemorate the event MUG will be holding a celebratory meal in Kenilworth.

On behalf of the MUG membership.

I’m also trying to work out how the RO !MuTools + IM can be used.

Some PDF pages do show browning of the text. But others really seem to have black text. FWIW with experiments to just the screen ‘cast’ I’d say you need about about a 20% saturation diff between RGB components to get a clear brown. And the black text in many scans seems of squash this in many cases. Varies from scanned magazine/book to another.

So one of the points I want to cover is have the prog analyse the stats of a page to show the stats how the frequency of RGB components vary with the level of each component, etc. Then have this control the ‘clean up’ to get optimum black ink on white paper for the output.

If I can do this I can do what I did for some earlier uses of running ‘C’ progs with CompoScript t get results… then write it up for Archive magazine.

BTW the newer versions of Compo are worth getting. They’d rather more powerful than one from 2008! Again IIRC I wrote about this for Archive. If you read that you may recall, for example, the script + ‘C’ prog that generates plots of E-field patterns around simple antenna systems, etc. Cane be found on the web as well.

TBH these days, though, I’m old, slow, and have 24/7 ‘carer’ duties. Plus have a poorer memory. So welcome help!</source:markdown>

      <title>Rasberry Pi - which is best in 2026?</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/5/topics/20240</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>Has anyone set up a dual boot linux / riscos on the pi? (e.g. using <span class="caps">PINN</span>)</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><span class="caps">PINN</span> may not be your best starting point.</p>
        <ol>
        	<li><span class="caps">RISC</span> OS, when booting from SD, wants a very specific partition layout. <span class="caps">NOOBS</span> (and its successor <span class="caps">PINN</span>) can achieve this if <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS is the first OS to be installed, but there is a significant risk that installing a second OS on the same SD card could prevent <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS from working thereafter. For <span class="caps">NOOBS</span> this was a show-stopper: the situation may have improved with recent <span class="caps">PINN</span> releases but I have not checked.</li>
        	<li><span class="caps">PINN</span> will be installing an older version of <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS (5.28) which comes with old firmware that does not support recent hardware revisions of the Pi 4 or Compute module 4.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>An alternative (hardware-based) method is to use a switch wired to one of the <span class="caps">GPIO</span> pins that config.txt can use to select which OS to boot. It might look something like this:</p>
        <pre><code>[gpio21=0]
        kernel=riscos.img

      <source:markdown>&#62; Has anyone set up a dual boot linux / riscos on the pi? (e.g. using PINN)

PINN may not be your best starting point.

1. RISC OS, when booting from SD, wants a very specific partition layout. NOOBS (and its successor PINN) can achieve this if RISC OS is the first OS to be installed, but there is a significant risk that installing a second OS on the same SD card could prevent RISC OS from working thereafter. For NOOBS this was a show-stopper: the situation may have improved with recent PINN releases but I have not checked.
2. PINN will be installing an older version of RISC OS (5.28) which comes with old firmware that does not support recent hardware revisions of the Pi 4 or Compute module 4.

An alternative (hardware-based) method is to use a switch wired to one of the GPIO pins that config.txt can use to select which OS to boot. It might look something like this:

```
[gpio21=0]
kernel=riscos.img
cmdline=riscos.txt

[gpio21=1]
kernel=kernel8.img
cmdline=cmdline.txt
```

Other parameters may (nay, will) need moving to these new sections in config.txt.

For a worked example, see [this post by Chris Hall](/forum/forums/11/topics/18870#posts-144233)

This is the technique used by RComp’s 4té and several offerings from RISCOSbits.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>RISCOSbits must announce the immediate discontinuation of their highly successful [VENOM](https://www.riscosbits.co.uk/venom.htm) premium NVMe RISC OS computer system. The last remaining machine left HQ earlier this week, to a new home.

As part of the eulogy for VENOM, it’s worth noting that it has been our most successful machine to date, selling more than any other system we’ve produced, although our [FAST NVMe](https://www.riscosbits.co.uk/fastnvme.htm) systems are hot on the heels. This has been especially surprising given its relatively short lifespan, but has been due, in no small part, to our excellent [FreeNVMe drivers](https://www.riscosbits.co.uk/nvme.htm), developed in conjunction with [RISC OS Open](https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/raspberry-pi) and [Stader Softwareenwicklung](http://www.stader-softwareentwicklung-gmbh.com.de/indexE.htm).

To mitigate the loss, we’ve introduced a couple of new systems to our website, to make amends. Well, more like one and a half!

The [PLUSFIVE](https://www.riscosbits.co.uk/plusfive.htm) is an add-on for the [DIYTHREE](https://www.riscosbits.co.uk/three.htm) to add a very capable Linux board to the system. Using the modular nature of the DIYTHREE case, the PLUSFIVE literally builds onto the existing system to add a Compute Module 5, running at 2.3GHz, with a base spec of 4GB RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage (NVMe is also available as an option). This can then be used to create a very powerful interconnected hybrid RISC OS/Linux system in a particularly small and expandable modular machine. This will be available to existing DIYTHREE users for £169.

The is a full kit and caboodle of a DIYTHREE and a PLUSFIVE is now also available, in the form of the new [STACKERDIY](https://www.riscosbits.co.uk/stacker.htm) kit. For just £369, you get the whole machine in one super compact case. For an extra £30, we can put it all together for you, with no DIY required!

Please check out our [DIY pages](https://www.riscosbits.co.uk/diy.htm) for details of what the PLUSFIVE and the STACKER can do. There’s a user-written review and build article in the current issue of [Archive](https://www.archivemag.co.uk) too.

As part of the process of updating the RISCOSbits website to reflect this, we have also taken the difficult decision to begin to reflect the [current changes in memory prices](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/ram-prices-are-exploding-heres-why-and-everything-you-need-to-know-about-surviving-ramageddon) that are hitting hard across the whole computing world.

I know this is a very old post to be replying to but I&#8217;m at my wits end trying to get to a desktop on a Bush <span class="caps">IBX</span> 100 set top box. I followed the instructions at the link that Rick Murray posted here and that I&#8217;ve found I believe on Chris Sawer&#8217;s website. I see it worked for you Rick but I&#8217;ve been going around in circles and whilst I&#8217;m almost there, I just cannot get the filer to run. I have pics of what I&#8217;m seeing but I don&#8217;t seem to be able to add them to this reply. The box is booting off the zip drive but as it boots I get the following messages: <br />
        File Filer:Templates not found<br />
        File Pinboard:Messages not found<br />
        File Filer_Run not found (presumably because the filer module has not loaded correctly so it doesn&#8217;t know what Filer_Run means)</p>
        <p>I then get to a desktop with the task manager (the green acorn icon) and the display manager showing on the taskbar (pinboard?) but no filer window open and no drive icons showing. I can get to the command line by pressing the menu button on the acorn icon and choosing commands but if I try &quot;filer_opendir IZIpFS::<span class="caps">ZIP</span>.$.Apps for example I just get &#8220;use *Desktop to Start the filer&#8221;. So it seems the filer module just does not load even though some things like the display manager do. I extracted the modules from the OS 3.7 roms running on an emulator on a PC using !zap. I then zipped them up with !zipEE, transferred them to a raspberry pi running risc OS which can read acorn formatted zip discs with a <span class="caps">USB</span> zip drive, transferred them to the drive that way, and then I use a parallel port zip drive to boot the <span class="caps">IBX</span> box. Phew! As I say I have pictures if there&#8217;s an easy way for me to send those. If anyone has any theories as to why this isn&#8217;t working for me I&#8217;d be eternally grateful. I followed the instructions at this link:</p>

      <source:markdown>You’re not being daft at all — this is one of those long-standing RPCEmu oddities that never really got a clean public explanation.

Short version: yes, a fix was discussed and partially prototyped back around 2011–2012, but it was never merged, and hard-disk support for RO5 remains deliberately disabled in RPCEmu.

A bit more detail:

RPCEmu’s hard-disc emulation was written to match RISC OS 4.x behaviour on the Risc PC. RISC OS 5 changed some low-level assumptions around disc drivers, timings, and error handling. When people tried RO5 HDD images, it exposed bugs in RPCEmu’s IDE emulation — data corruption, [https://tropical-casino.com/](https://tropical-casino.com/) bad geometry reporting, and subtle filesystem breakage rather than clean crashes. That’s why the support was disabled rather than left “use at your own risk”.

The fix you’re remembering was essentially a workaround that made RO5 mount an image, but it didn’t fully solve the corruption issues. From the maintainer’s point of view at the time, half-working storage emulation was worse than none, so it never went upstream.

As for how it’s disabled: you’re right, it’s not in the ROMs. RPCEmu checks the OS version it thinks it’s running and refuses to attach IDE devices for RO5 builds. It’s done in the emulator logic rather than the filesystem layer, which is why it’s not obvious at first glance in the source.

Could you enable it locally? Yes — people have done so by removing or bypassing the RO5 checks — but it’s risky. You may get something that appears to work and then quietly corrupts the image. That’s the big reason it hasn’t been officially re-enabled.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Posting an incorrect statement on the internet wins again! Thanks @Piers.

With `-C opt-level=3` there’s no stack used at all, even if I make the code a little more practical. There are a lot of nops, because the parameter to writec is already in r0.

@Paolo, When I try to install with rustup target add armv4t-none-eabi I get

      <source:markdown>I have a feeling that I might be missing something obvious here…

I have a dialogue box as a submenu (a program information window), which has a toggle size icon so that the user can expand it to read additional details about the application. This works fine.

However, it would be nice if it could always open in the small state, to be a little bit tidier. With a normal window, this would just be a case of fiddling with the visible extent before calling Wimp\_OpenWindow, but as a submenu, I can’t see how to do it.

I can set the submenu warning flag and catch Message\_SubmenuWarning, but as far as I know that gives me the window handle and not the Open Window block. Similarly, Wimp\_CreateSubmenu doesn’t take anything but the handle, so I can’t mess with the visible area before creating the dialogue on screen.

Sitting on Open Window events for the dialogue suggests that the application doesn’t receive one until the window is moved, not when it initially opens – so that doesn’t appear to help either.

Is there any way to achieve what I’m trying to do? Or is it a case of “I wouldn’t start from here”, and I need another approach to displaying the additional info (or just live with the toggled state persisting between visits)?</source:markdown>

_“I had the same issue and I just found what was the root cause in my case._

_In “Hardware and Power” —&#62; “HDD Hibernation” I had options “Enable advance HDD Hibernation” and “DS will enter standby via WOL after the HDD has hibernated” both checked._

_This caused the NAS to power off, or maybe just to enter standby, but it did not wake up by itself, simply accessing the storage of through the web interface. I removed the “enter standby” flag and everything works fine for me now.&#34;_</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Hiya,

There’s been a little bit of discussion about how people who are not technical can contribute towards work. One of the ways that has been suggested has been to provide donations towards people or that work. To try to provide a mechanism for this, I’ve decided to use the GitHub Sponsorship button.

On many of my GitHub projects, including the general \`riscos64-status\` project ( [https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status](https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status)), there is a Sponsor button. This will take you to [https://github.com/sponsors/gerph/](https://github.com/sponsors/gerph/) where you can provide a sponsorship.

Providing sponsorship will encourage more development and tools for this project.

If you feel that the things that I’m doing and the work towards RISC OS 64 is valuable, please feel free to sponsor me!</source:markdown>

Firstly, do you mean 4.68f2 (last version of 4.68) or 4.69f12?

I’ve compared the printing code in 4.69f14 vs 4.70a20 and there aren’t that many differences. There’s some changes to how headers and footers are handled, and changes to make the print dbox override of the mode font height/width work.

If you’re using headers/footers then try turning them off and see if that helps.

ISTR an earlier report of PS3 issues but I can’t find that right now. Anyway, try printing with the PS2 driver, if possible. That will show if there is an issue with PS3 or if it’s a more generic problem.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Firstly, don’t tick “act as IP router”. If you fill in anything in the Routing window, only put the address of your router – leave everything else blank. If using DHCP, leave everything blank/unticked.

If this doesn’t work, be aware that one of the first signs of a failing Iyonix PSU is the network port failing. USB ethernet is possible on RISC OS – stick to USB 2 adapters though, ideally with ASIX AX88772 chipset. Not every ROM has EtherUSB in ROM though.

RISC OS cannot use USB soundcards at all without a custom ROM. Even then, it can’t use it system-wide, only via specific software.

Finally, be aware that Iyonixes are amongst the more troublesome machines to keep going (see Martin Eastwood’s problems).

      <source:markdown>For those who enjoyed [Rob Napier’s talk at ROUGOL](https://rougol.jellybaby.net/meetings/2025/dec.html) last month, and those who missed it but were also excited to read the full history of Acorn, here’s a message from Rob about progress on publication of his book:

* * *

Over the holiday break, VOICESFROM A FUTUREPASSED has moved toward publication.

I am cautiously confident that it will be released on 1 March online through Amazon and through some bookshops and possibly some museum shops.

I have set up an information site at [www.doitonce.net.au](https://www.doitonce.net.au/) . It gives an outline of the book and a campaign to donate part of the sale price to museums. Please visit the site for details.

If you would like to pre-order or to contact me, just send me a message from there. I try to respond to everyone within one business day.

My HTML skills are a bit rusty and I’ve not managed to get too excited about current web design trends. If anyone has any comments/feedback, I’d be happy to receive your advice. That said: Please be gentle.

All the best

Rob Napier

      <title>App locations inside !Boot</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m beginning to delve into the murky innards of !Boot, with a view to extending the Clarity theme to the various default apps within it, including Configure. Presently, the sprites in the Clarity theme are installed with a simple Boot merge, with the new files all added into <code>!Boot.Resources.!ThemeDefs.Themes.Clarity</code>. This ensures that the sprites used by the Wimp, plus the icons used for the <span class="caps">ROM</span> Apps, are replaced.</p>
        <p>If I also want to replace the icons used for the various !Boot apps (!Scrap, !System, etc), then I&#8217;m assuming that I can use the same Boot merge to add the required sprites into their various application directories (ie, <code>!Boot.Resources.!System.Themes.Clarity</code>, etc). This does assume that those application directories never move around &#8211; is that something I can rely on?</p>
        <p>Similarly, the icons for the Configure app aren&#8217;t all in the same place. On RO5.31, most are in <code>!Boot.RO500Hook.Res.Configure</code>, but the Internet configuration seems to live in <code>!Boot.Resources.Configure</code>. Again, can I rely on these locations staying consistent, and use a Boot merge to add new sprites into their respective app directories?</p>
        <p>I&#8217;m aware that there are theme manager applications in development, such as ExtTheme, that will probably be able to handle all this with a bit more aplomb, but I&#8217;m hoping to keep the basic distribution of Clarity as simple as possible &#8211; just an iconset that can be copied over !Boot with the various components dropped into the right places.</p>]]>

With that, I think I’m done on what I want to do on the Kernel Introspection for now – it’s stubbed well enough. I think next week, I think I’m going to have a look at FSCommands, unless anyone wants to jump in and ask for one of the other components…

Most of Phase 1 is complete ( [https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Phase-1](https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Phase-1)) but Phase 2 has lots of things in it ( [https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Phase-2](https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Phase-2)).</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Hiya,

Just a little note to say that the PicoC tool that I’ve been using for some of the verification of 32-bit and 64-bit components has been released. PicoC is an interpreted C, which you can use at the command line or with files. It’s handy for writing small things in which just exercise a few SWI calls.

It is even passing its almost all the original tests that were supplied with it (those not run are largely for time).

      <source:markdown>&#62; There are a quite a few things that don’t take into account the screen scaling when using EX0 EY0. The mouse pointer is one of them.

The OS _does_ scale the mouse pointer for the eigen factors, witness changing to a EX1 EY2 mode. The issue is that a number of APIs assume no more than 32×32 hardware cursor (probably arising from VIDC, but I think some other graphics controllers have that limit too) so for example when you try to scale ptr\_default which is 22 pixels high at EX1 EY1 you’d get 44 pixels at EX0 EY0 and the bottom 12 pixels are cropped off. The hourglass with percentage is taller still.

So your options are:

- Live with the cropped pointer. Result: at least it’s proportionally the right size compared with everything else
- Fudge it by using the 12×22 pixel pointer sprite in the Wimp’s Sprites11 file, this is what Castle opted to do with the Iyonix and that’s spread to some of the other themes. Result: at least it’s not cropped, just a bit teeny tiny
- Roll up your sleeves and ripple [the planned API changes](/wiki/documentation/show/Proposed%20GraphicsV%20enhancements#TOC3.3) through all the bits of low level graphics drivers which assume 32×32. Result: not cropped and correctly scaled on hardware that can do bigger overlays</source:markdown>

The latter is a 32-bit stubs, patched automatically. It uses a python (extended) implementation of decaof to rename certain symbols in the symbol table in the .o files, and includes in the library veneers. These veneers export the original function name, and call the renamed functions. And they&#8217;re all made into a library with a python reimplementation of libfile. It sounds like it works very similarly to StubsG?</p>]]>

      <source:markdown>&#62; It relies on parts of the C library, which makes it problematic. StubsG is available as a binary and works – it should be usable as-is. Is there a particular issue you have found with the library?

The C library’s Apache licensed, so as long as you’re willing to make your code have a compatible licence it should be fine.

If it’s of interest, I have a (macOS/Linux) Makefile that fetches the source for stubs and builds three variants – 26bit, 32bit and vfp. The latter is a 32-bit stubs, patched automatically. It uses a python (extended) implementation of decaof to rename certain symbols in the symbol table in the .o files, and includes in the library veneers. These veneers export the original function name, and call the renamed functions. And they’re all made into a library with a python reimplementation of libfile.

Plus a bunch of excessive logging, but that’s another matter.

If I were them, I’d have gone for a `-preload file,address` option, myself, to cover all eventualities like bios, kernel, inird, etc..

      <source:markdown>I was just thinking about somewhere safe for privileged code to write to for user mode code to read from and thought perhaps the system heap, since that’s where I thought the system variables are stored (and R3 returned from `OS_ReadVarVal` points to).

So I tried:

`SYS&#34;XOS_ReadVarVal&#34;, &#34;*&#34;, 0, -1, 0, 0 TO ,,,V%`

V% is set to &#38;303FF7CC, in the system heap, not RMA (&#38;20000000) and printing the string there shows “7backup$Dir”, as expected. What I wasn’t expecting was `V%?5=42` to work, let alone change the name of the variable to “7back\*p$Dir”!

      <title>Happy Christmas and New Year from all at R-Comp and ROD</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Firstly, I&#8217;d like to wish everyone a Happy Christmas and a super, <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS-filled 2026.  Thankyou to eveyone for being part of the community this  year, and for all your <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS related activity, support, developments, purchases and forum posts etc.</p>
        <p>I&#8217;m now finishing for Christmas (well, it is nearly 4pm on Christmas Eve).  The intention is to take a bit of a longer Christmas break as I&#8217;m absolutely exhausted from a non-stop year.  I&#8217;ve been working weekends since the summer, and still not found time to celebrate my birthday from back in October!  We&#8217;ve more-or-less cleared the decks in time for Christmas, so the plan is to take a rest until early Jan.</p>
        <p>My intention is to return to work properly on Jan 12th, although I may well be checking email from the 7th onwards &#8211; if you can avoid sending tech support emails until then, it&#8217;d be appreciated.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Plingstore will continue to operate, although please be patient as I&#8217;ll likely only be approving orders every few days.</p>
        <p>Christmas cards &#8211; I&#8217;m afraid we simply haven&#8217;t had a chance to do the usual Christmas Card send-out this year, so if you were expecting one and haven&#8217;t received, please don&#8217;t take it personally.  Hopefully normal service will be resumed next year.  I may try and slip a few out whilst listening to &#8220;Carols from Kings&#8221; this afternoon, but it is a wee bit late now.</p>
        <p>Warrington Show (<span class="caps">RISC</span> OS North) is on Saturday, March 21st, 2026 &#8211; see <a href="http://www.riscosnorth.uk">www.riscosnorth.uk</a> for more info.  We&#8217;ve been slow on getting exhibitor invites out this year, but please pencil this date into your diary (the show has been paid for, so it is definitely happening).  We hope to see you there if possible :)</p>
        <p>I hope you all have a really nice Chirstmas period, and have exactly the balance of fun, friendship, food, relaxation and <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS that you wish for :)</p>

      <source:markdown>Firstly, I’d like to wish everyone a Happy Christmas and a super, RISC OS-filled 2026. Thankyou to eveyone for being part of the community this year, and for all your RISC OS related activity, support, developments, purchases and forum posts etc.

I’m now finishing for Christmas (well, it is nearly 4pm on Christmas Eve). The intention is to take a bit of a longer Christmas break as I’m absolutely exhausted from a non-stop year. I’ve been working weekends since the summer, and still not found time to celebrate my birthday from back in October! We’ve more-or-less cleared the decks in time for Christmas, so the plan is to take a rest until early Jan.

My intention is to return to work properly on Jan 12th, although I may well be checking email from the 7th onwards – if you can avoid sending tech support emails until then, it’d be appreciated.

In the meantime, Plingstore will continue to operate, although please be patient as I’ll likely only be approving orders every few days.

Christmas cards – I’m afraid we simply haven’t had a chance to do the usual Christmas Card send-out this year, so if you were expecting one and haven’t received, please don’t take it personally. Hopefully normal service will be resumed next year. I may try and slip a few out whilst listening to “Carols from Kings” this afternoon, but it is a wee bit late now.

Warrington Show (RISC OS North) is on Saturday, March 21st, 2026 – see [www.riscosnorth.uk](http://www.riscosnorth.uk) for more info. We’ve been slow on getting exhibitor invites out this year, but please pencil this date into your diary (the show has been paid for, so it is definitely happening). We hope to see you there if possible :)

I hope you all have a really nice Chirstmas period, and have exactly the balance of fun, friendship, food, relaxation and RISC OS that you wish for :)

Best wishes to everyone,

      <title>GCCSDK Built with Nix!</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that I am the only person using <span class="caps">GCCSDK</span> via nix, but I&#8217;ve got some updates!<br />
        Firstly, I&#8217;m using it to compile for RiscOS from an Apple Silicon Mac!  It will also definitely work on windows using <span class="caps">WSL</span>! So if you are using any of those platforms, great news! This will work a charm!</p>
        <p>Next, I&#8217;ve managed to create an initial cross stdenv which means that it is much easier to use nix as the build system. The example flake is here:<br />
        <a href="https://github.com/yobson/riscos-nix/tree/main/example">https://github.com/yobson/riscos-nix/tree/main/example</a></p>
        <p>Next steps will be building OSLib and others this way and move some things over from the auto builder. I also spotted the nordsoft compiler on GitHub (I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the one <span class="caps">ROOL</span> uses but will work for risc os), so I may give that the same treatment.</p>
        <p>Either way, this is turning out to be a very nice way to bring building for risc os to 2025.</p>]]>

CRamFS + memmove:

I’ve added a bunch of comments on the merge request of things that might help, but I currently don’t have any tools for getting more detailed benchmarks on the RiscPC.

        <![CDATA[<p>Some more thoughts on Paint, having been using it very heavily over the past few weeks:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The various bugs that used to affect various tools in the Sprite window seem to have been very effectively squashed. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve had a single crash from that source over many hours of use.</li>
        	<li>The new outline font tool is great, as is the much better Paintbrush interface. Very nice work.</li>
        	<li>There&#8217;s a bug report (ticket 520) open on the file dragging/selection in the Spritefile window. This issue would be great to look at &#8211; it&#8217;s pretty annoying to drag a sprite into a file window and have it replace whatever is currently selected, even if the sprites have different names. When dragging dozens of files around, it&#8217;s very easy to overwrite stuff by mistake this way.</li>
        	<li>Relatedly, if you try to rename a sprite in a Spritefile window to one that already exists, Paint silently fails to rename it, rather than telling you why.</li>
        	<li>The only crashes I&#8217;ve had came when deleting a sprite from a Spritefile window. Annoyingly, I can&#8217;t reproduce this reliably. If I can find some way to reproduce this, I&#8217;ll file a ticket.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I&#8217;m not sure if the Bounty work is still current. If it is, then taking a look at some of these issues in the Spritefile window would be really useful. I think possible fixes here would be to:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Mimic the Filer&#8217;s selection behaviour, so that selecting sprites in one Spritefile window clears the previous selection in another window</li>
        	<li>Alternatively (or in addition), don&#8217;t overwrite selected sprites with different names when dragging sprite(s) into a Spritefile window, but just add the new sprites to the Spritefile</li>
        	<li>When a sprite or selection of sprites is dragged to a Spritefile window containing a sprite(s) with the same name, or the user tries to rename a sprite with a name already existing in the file, query the decision. Either halt it, or offer to skip/abort/overwrite.</li>

      <source:markdown>Some more thoughts on Paint, having been using it very heavily over the past few weeks:

- The various bugs that used to affect various tools in the Sprite window seem to have been very effectively squashed. I don’t think I’ve had a single crash from that source over many hours of use.
- The new outline font tool is great, as is the much better Paintbrush interface. Very nice work.
- There’s a bug report (ticket 520) open on the file dragging/selection in the Spritefile window. This issue would be great to look at – it’s pretty annoying to drag a sprite into a file window and have it replace whatever is currently selected, even if the sprites have different names. When dragging dozens of files around, it’s very easy to overwrite stuff by mistake this way.
- Relatedly, if you try to rename a sprite in a Spritefile window to one that already exists, Paint silently fails to rename it, rather than telling you why.
- The only crashes I’ve had came when deleting a sprite from a Spritefile window. Annoyingly, I can’t reproduce this reliably. If I can find some way to reproduce this, I’ll file a ticket.

I’m not sure if the Bounty work is still current. If it is, then taking a look at some of these issues in the Spritefile window would be really useful. I think possible fixes here would be to:

- Mimic the Filer’s selection behaviour, so that selecting sprites in one Spritefile window clears the previous selection in another window
- Alternatively (or in addition), don’t overwrite selected sprites with different names when dragging sprite(s) into a Spritefile window, but just add the new sprites to the Spritefile
- When a sprite or selection of sprites is dragged to a Spritefile window containing a sprite(s) with the same name, or the user tries to rename a sprite with a name already existing in the file, query the decision. Either halt it, or offer to skip/abort/overwrite.

In any case, congrats to Andy for all his hard work – the app has been really transformed.</source:markdown>

The session yesterday went quite well, despite feeling a little unwell through it. Implementation of the stubbed functions is progressing well. OS\_Byte calls are stubbed, although I went back and forth on their naming, as they seem to be given different names in different places. OS\_ReadSysInfo has about a third of the calls stubbed as well. We’re only getting a skeleton right now, so it’s not especially complicated.

Tests have been ported from RISC OS Pyromaniac and look ok – they will need to change as we update the implementation.

Next week I’ll look at the OS\_Platform calls and probably the memory calls as well.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>I’ve just had the same issue with RDPClient connecting to a new install of Windows 11 Professional 25H2.

There were some additional settings that I needed to change to get RDPClient to connect. (I was seeing the same “connection reset by peer error”)

1\. Open GPEDIT.MSC

2\. Expand Computer Configuration &#62; Administrative Templates &#62; Windows Components &#62; Remote Desktop Services &#62; Remote Desktop Session Host &#62; Security

3\. Change “Set client connection encryption level” to “LOW”

4\. Change &#34;Require use of specific security layer for remote (RDP) connections to “RDP”

5\. Change &#34;Require user authentication for remote connections by using Network Level Authtication to “DISABLED”

6\. Reboot the PC

Obviously lowering the security defaults for Remote Desktop is a bad idea security wise, so use at your own risk!</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>It’s been about 5 weeks since I did a status update on the 64-bit RISC OS work.

- The Wimp Templates subcomponent was worked on as part of the Live Coding and is now complete – See [https://github.com/gerph/riscos-wimp-templates](https://github.com/gerph/riscos-wimp-templates) for the details.
- The \`riscos64-status\` repository has been updated with a few things:
  - \`PicoC\` is noted as a ported language.
  - \`Lua\` is noted as a ported language.
  - \`TCC\` is noted as a ported implementation of a C compiler.
  - \`GCC\` was removed from the ported implementations (it’s not ported, but is usable to build for RISC OS 64, and had been misplaced).
  - \`Pascal\` is noted as a ported language (using the P2C tool).
  - \`Rust\` is noted as having been prototyped for use with RISC OS 64.
  - All the feature documents for component now include completion percentages on their pages.
- The \`Kernel: Modules\` subcomponent had been started.
- The \`EvaluateExpression\` module has been stubbed.
- The \`IIC\` module has been stubbed.
- The \`OSSWIs\` module has been stubbed.
- The hourglass maker has been ported to RISC OS 64. See [https://github.com/gerph/riscos-hourglass-maker](https://github.com/gerph/riscos-hourglass-maker) for details.

  - The module can be found in the \`riscos64-status\` repository as with many others.
- The Pascal-to-C implementation is being worked into the build environment.
- I presented the general status of RISC OS 64 work to ROUGOL, and the presentation is available on YouTube and through my presentation site. See [https://presentations.riscos.online/pyromaniac4/index.…](https://presentations.riscos.online/pyromaniac4/index.html) for video, slides and resource links.

- \`objasm2gas\` tool has been updated to handle \`:INDEX:\` and \`:BASE:\` (as well as the \`@\` metavariable), and fix problems with field mappings using registers not being calculated as expressions.
- The \`Kernel: Introspection\` component will be the next live coding project.

Anyhow, that’s where things are for me. You can always follow the repositories to see what’s being done.

      <source:markdown>So I have this interesting device – it is a Raspad 3 (combined with a RP4b 4GB).

I am sure i recently got it to boot RISC OS 5.31 but it hasn’t done so again today so will have to play with it more. When it did boot the screen worked but not the touchscreen function (it’s RISC OS) – the touch screen works in Raspberry Pi OS and identifies as a ilitek-tp screen working on HDMI.

Has anyone got any idea if this can be made to work with RISC OS.

Apparently the ilitek-tp screen is a capacitive type device.

Also don’t think the USB ports on the main board (not the Rpi4) were working with RISC OS but let’s start with the screen.

If i can’t get it working with RISC OS then it may get used as a Pi-Core music player.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>RISC OS already support OpenGL. This wish list item would be to provide a simple module translating GL or VUlkan(?) calls to an appropriate SWI. in BASIC you would then do SYS “GLFunc”,“@”, PTR `param_block`.

Where GLFunc gets 2 pointers, 1(string) to the name of OPenGL(ES) or Vulkan Function, and the second param being a sutiable width pointer to the parameter block.

Alternatively it would be nice to have some kind of native 3D api, that can be called directly from Basic.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>With uncharacteristic speed following the release of Puzzles 1.00 for RISC OS, version 1.01 is now available to download from [https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/games](https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/games) – copies can also be found on the PlingStore, and should appear in PackMan shortly.

The main changes from 1.00 are a few updates [from the upstream](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/) – the user-facing ones are to the Dominosa, Mines and Undead games.

The RISC OS front end now supports the `text_fallback()` function, which allows it to make the characters in the top half of the current RISC OS character set available to games if they wish to make use of them. This improves the text display in a couple of the puzzles. If you’re playing Puzzles on a platform that doesn’t support the UCS lookup tables, or are using an alphabet that doesn’t have the desired glyphs in it, then games will continue to use plain ASCII as before.</source:markdown>

Vodafone will move to IPv6 post merger, but I have no idea of the timescale on that. Their fixed broadband has supported it for a while.</source:markdown>

I wouldn’t bother. Pretty much every solution for running RISC OS applications supported sound. The ‘RISC OS On Linux’ project, totally understandably, hasn’t got around to that yet. And if you are just using typical desktop apps, then it’s no big deal. We are talking about one implementation here, with what, a handful of users. I’d be stunned if it was worth the effort.

Also, I think for most games, the sound is key too.

If anyone wants to spend time on it, I’d suggest a module which accepts the relevant SWIs/vectors/whatever for the sound APIs, and just does nothing with them.

      <source:markdown>To everyone interested,

I have completed testing the new Theme “Actuator” for my ExtTheme. At the moment, to load a new theme I am using CHris (Little Yellow Moon) original Theme Configure plug-in, but I need to rewrite that, because ExtTheme allow a use to customize a theme (and remembers the customizations between theme switching).

Check this link to have a look at which Themes are already available (there are more than the screenshots in the article), but this gives you an overview:

[https://paolozaino.wordpress.com/2025/11/30/dme-projec…](https://paolozaino.wordpress.com/2025/11/30/dme-project-porting-a-lot-of-themes-to-the-new-exttheme/)

Note for Chris and Martin:

I am trying to write some documentation, as soon as I am done I’ll figure out a way for you both to be able to install this and start playing with it.

Please DO NOT use your daily RISC OS system for these tests! I need to replace the Configure plugin and the update may leave stuff behind! So this is just to test your own themes.

I am planning a public beta for Christmas if I have enough time.</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[<p>Ok guys,</p>
        <p>let me disable the wobbly stuff (there are quite a few, because I started to reverse engineer <span class="caps">WTB</span> patch if anyone remebers it, to add it to my ExtTheme and allow even more customizability), I&#8217;ll package it and give it to both of you for testing.</p>
        <p>It should take me a few days max.</p>
        <p>ExtTheme already has all your work Chris for your old Theme Manager, so you&#8217;ll need to create a theme file with all the configuration options like you did in the past. The Theme file format is identical (I kept the same format for compatibility with the past Themes made for your TM).

      <source:markdown>Ok guys,

let me disable the wobbly stuff (there are quite a few, because I started to reverse engineer WTB patch if anyone remebers it, to add it to my ExtTheme and allow even more customizability), I’ll package it and give it to both of you for testing.

It should take me a few days max.

ExtTheme already has all your work Chris for your old Theme Manager, so you’ll need to create a theme file with all the configuration options like you did in the past. The Theme file format is identical (I kept the same format for compatibility with the past Themes made for your TM). There are more options now, and it does work fine with coloring the windows border (well it can do even more than that, and add size to the border too, but that size is one of the wobbly functions).

It also already includes all the features of ThemeDef from ROOL, and everything is rewritten in C (’cause some folks complained that DME Launchpad was written in BBCBASIC…).

I’ll need both your emails, please contact me at the link below, and as soon as I have disabled the things that makes RO unstable I’ll send you a PackMan package that should install both the Configure UI and the Theme actuator.

A required note: This is alpha quality code, so there might be issues even with the unstable features disabled.

One of the funniest unstable feature is having the iconbar on the left (or right or top) of the screen (yes can do that too), it works, BUT it also duplicate the iconbar XD – I am still fighting with that one, so will be disabled.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>&#62; No i think its been misunderstood, what im doing is seperate from anyone else, i wanted to do interviews at the London Show and record, but i was put off, then i was approached by ROD which indicated its something they wanted for north so i said i would look into it. Whoever is handling the theatre talks will be doing the same again.

That’s odd, because what you originally wrote – in response to perceived quality issues with the London theatre videos – was

&#62; I’m planning to go to the north show next year and upload videos, but mirror the presentations with a PIP approach to having the host in the talks.

which certainly read as if you were planning to video the talks. If not, then we have all indeed misunderstood[1](#fn1); in that case, apologies.

&#62; No one has said anything about taking over anyone’s job, Not that i knew that certain individuals had roles reserved to themselves.

They don’t. But common sense says that when you have a platform running off a limited pool of volunteers, and also have volunteers happily in place doing some roles, it’s generally best to see if new volunteers can take on roles that aren’t already being done. Instead of finding out that the volunteers who you’ve just displaced from constructive roles have little interest in doing something else and have just buggered off into the sunset taking their skills with them.

If the original volunteers are looking for a change of scenery, on the other hand, then go for it. Obviously.

&#62; I do think the idea of a video with little interviews where possible of attendees and possibly exhibitors if possible would maybe help encourage people is a good one as it could complement the theatre talks.

Indeed, although a small word of caution: it does need to be planned in advance (which can be before the show opens, if you’re not getting under people’s feet, or during the day), so that exhibitors know to expect an interview and don’t just have a live camera shoved in their face. Sorry, but the latter has happened before (as have other things that you might not expect – after many years exhibiting at events, I’ve learned the hard way that some corners of the RISC OS community are… odd). This may explain some of the cynicism being expressed. That’s also why recorded and edited is better than livestreamed: with the live option, some people may be unhappy with what gets out[2](#fn2).

[1](#fnr1) or have been misdirected?

[2](#fnr2) WROCC’s videos tend to be edited, I think. Usually just to remove the more blatant pauses and awkward bits, but sometimes to remove things that presenters have got cold feet over in the cold light of the next day.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Not only did 1977 see the release of space opera [Star Wars – A New Hope](https://www.disneyplus.com/en-gb/welcome/star-wars), but it was also a year famous for the release of Fortran 77, the follow up to Fortran IV and ’66.

### Your compliance is imperative

Fortran is one of a family of _imperative_ programming languages, and was originally short for **For** mula **Tran** slation. Finding applications in scientific fields such as modelling of weather systems, molecular structure, and of course calculating star ship propulsion vectors.

Image available as wallpaper from [r33v01v3](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1941346742) via Steam

As described in our [FAQ](/content/documents/dde-faq) the imperative languages are in the class of languages that the Norcroft compiler supports, and we’ve long known from odd scraps of evidence such as the [RISC iX User Guide](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/34486/Acorn-RISC-iX-User-Guide/) that there was a Fortran version at one time which went alongside the C language we’re so much more familiar with.

With help from Codemist a search of their archives managed to locate a partial copy last worked on in the 1990s on a backup tape stowed inside an old R2-unit.

Joining the Fortran front end – the part of the compiler which deals with language specifics – with the rest of the contemporary tools creates the `f77` compiler. In addition, a brand new 200+ page manual describes its use in detail, along with ANSI runtime library.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>A few things in no particular order.

1) There was a security permissions “gotcha” that we’d not spotted that came in during a gitlab update a few months ago that was preventing the automatic git mirroring occurring for the TCP/IP 6 project. This has now been resolved, so the code should now auto-update between the internal project git and the ROD git. As a result, the missing 7.09 code is now present as expected.

2) AFAIK that auto-mirroring only applies to that specific project, and happens more-or-less in realtime, so should always reflect latest code. Those wishing to contribute should contact us for further info. Other project repositories work as you would normally expect.

3) Vprotect and Killer sources are now in the ROD git. However, they are not publicly visible due to concerns over security, and there not being enough remaining skilled coders to provide the necessary levels of peer review.

4) My goal would be for public binary builds to appear ASAP

5) Access to those git repositories is available on request, but it is likely we will vet applicants to at least some degree because of the sensitivity of the materials. We have already had one compelling offer to provide long term maintenance of this software, but I’m aware other work has been done and am keen to see all interested parties working together on this.

6) The hint about the Explore link was in the “Explore the github” but you can do so directly via [https://gitlab.riscosdev.com/explore](https://gitlab.riscosdev.com/explore)

7) Don’t expect to see the Vprotect/Killer projects in the public “explore” due to their sensitivity, until such time as releases are ready.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Yes, though remember Gadget is a variable size depending on the gadget. The original Toolbox manual describes it the best as it highlights various pitfalls.

Set num\_gadgets and they then go sequentially in the ‘data’ field. Each gadget has a size, which is (usually) the offset to the next gadget.

[http://www.riscos.com/support/developers/toolbox/windo…](http://www.riscos.com/support/developers/toolbox/windows.html#26511)

[http://www.riscos.com/support/developers/toolbox/windo…](http://www.riscos.com/support/developers/toolbox/windows.html#14545)

The pitfalls are that you shouldn’t assume the size of each header (ie. Window template or Gadget template) and instead use the offsets “The use of a body\_offset field is to allow expansion in the header, without losing backwards compatibility.” Similarly ‘gadgets’ is an offset, in the Window template, and “type/size” has the gadget size in the gadget top two bytes (the second link above describes “type/size”).

For reading a file, you should handle the offsets properly, but the reality is they are just memory dumps of the C structures that have never changed size.

Annoyingly, it says “Note that for the gadgets listed below, the size is ‘built in’ to the Window module, and so the size can be set to zero…” which is ridiculous, so means you’ll have to hard-code the sizes for the original gadget set. I think you should use the built-in size if the value in the file is zero, and the value in the file if it’s non-zero.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>&#62; Are there any more !UnixFonts available for Iris? or can we add more?

See [https://freetype.org/freetype2/docs/index.html](https://freetype.org/freetype2/docs/index.html) for supported font types.

There are some available via PackMan.

&#62; and is there any reason Iris can?t use the full font system on risc os?

It would be better to ask ‘is there any reason why RISC OS can’t use FreeType for it’s font system’.</source:markdown>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The article today about using RPCEmu on macOS reminded me that I&#8217;ve not mentioned the Docker images for RPCEmu that I created some time ago since they were updated.

        docker run -it --rm -p 5901:5901 -v $PWD:/riscos/Shared gerph/rpcemu-5
        </pre>
        <p>then connect to the <span class="caps">VNC</span> server (with Screen Sharing, or some other client) at localhost:5901 and use the password <code>password</code>.</p>
        <p>The current working directory is shared into <code>$.Shared</code>.</p>
        <p>As this is a separate configuration, a clean system, and has access to the filesystem it&#8217;s really trivial to customise, or just use for running those odd things that you need now and then. And you can be sure that you&#8217;ve not broken the system as it&#8217;s exactly as distributed.</p>
        <p>The disc image is as supplied by the easy start bundles, with tiny tweaks (removing the Acorn logo from the backdrop, changing the screen mode to be larger, and adding a module that resizes the X server on mode change). This also has the interesting side effect of making the system rather more useable when made full screen.</p>
        <p>And of course, being docker, you can also run this on Linux and on Windows, and it&#8217;ll be pretty much the same.</p>

      <source:markdown>The article today about using RPCEmu on macOS reminded me that I’ve not mentioned the Docker images for RPCEmu that I created some time ago since they were updated. It also made me finally add the automatic resizing and push a multi-arch image (coo, I can now do both ARM and AMD in the same image!).

To use…

```
docker run -it --rm -p 5901:5901 -v $PWD:/riscos/Shared gerph/rpcemu-3.7

```

or

```
docker run -it --rm -p 5901:5901 -v $PWD:/riscos/Shared gerph/rpcemu-5

```

then connect to the VNC server (with Screen Sharing, or some other client) at localhost:5901 and use the password `password`.

The current working directory is shared into `$.Shared`.

As this is a separate configuration, a clean system, and has access to the filesystem it’s really trivial to customise, or just use for running those odd things that you need now and then. And you can be sure that you’ve not broken the system as it’s exactly as distributed.

The disc image is as supplied by the easy start bundles, with tiny tweaks (removing the Acorn logo from the backdrop, changing the screen mode to be larger, and adding a module that resizes the X server on mode change). This also has the interesting side effect of making the system rather more useable when made full screen.

And of course, being docker, you can also run this on Linux and on Windows, and it’ll be pretty much the same.

Sources, as usual, are on GitHub – [https://github.com/gerph/rpcemu-docker](https://github.com/gerph/rpcemu-docker).

      <source:markdown>Long term readers of these fora may remember that I think Printer Manager is far too big to be extended to deal with IPP printers in its present BASIC form.

It occurred to me that it might be possible to translate it to C, in small increments, leaving it testable at all times, by translating bottom-up (i.e. replacing the lowest level functions and procedures first) and replacing them with calls to a module written in C. The module would only be needed until all the translation is done, by which time we’d have a complete translation into C that then would be converted from a module to an app.

Printer Manager is an enormous job to take on top-down, as nothing could be used until it’s all done. The way I’m suggesting would have something testable and usable (the ultimate test of testability!) at all stages.

Any thoughts?</source:markdown>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I have always thought that <span class="caps">BBC</span> <span class="caps">BASIC</span> needed records.</p>
        <p>RTR&#8217;s BASICs have Structures, but the syntax doesn&#8217;t really feel native to <span class="caps">BBC</span> <span class="caps">BASIC</span>.</p>
        <p>I have been a fan of Wirth&#8217;s Oberon with type extension of records as it is a clean simple concept.</p>
        <p>Most OO languages go off into the weeds with very complex and subtle features that are not really needed for 99% of programs.</p>
        <p>I have outlined a possible syntax/semantics for a simplified <span class="caps">OOP</span> style record structure description below.</p>
        <p>Let me know what you think.</p>
        <p><span class="caps">OUTLINE</span> OF <span class="caps">CONCEPT</span>:</p>
        <p>Defininng a record type</p>
        <p>No Args (fixed size)</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><span class="caps">DEF</span> RECmyrec<br />
        A%	//	Integer field<br />
        B	//	Floating field<br />
        C$	//	String field	<br />
        D@	//	Pointer field (any RECxxx) initial value <span class="caps">NULL</span><br />
        <span class="caps">DIM</span> E% 1024	//	Raw byte block field 1kB inline in record, use with indirection operators<br />
        <span class="caps">DIM</span> F%(9)	//	Array of 10 ints<br />
        <span class="caps">DIM</span> G(9)	//	Array of 10 floats<br />
        <span class="caps">DIM</span> H$(9)	//	Array of 10 strings<br />
        <span class="caps">DIM</span> I@(9)	//	Array of 10 pointer to record initial value <span class="caps">NULL</span><br />
        <span class="caps">ENDREC</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>With Args (variable size and initial values)</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p><span class="caps">DEF</span> RECmyvarrec(n$,m%,blocksize%)<br />
        name$ = n$		//  Initialise value<br />
        <span class="caps">DIM</span> list$(m%)	//	n+1 strings &#8211; record contains a pointer to the array<br />
        <span class="caps">DIM</span> block% blocksize%*2+38	//	can do calculations; specifies number of bytes, numbered 0 to result-1<br />
        <span class="caps">ENDREC</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p></p>
        <p>Global or Private</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>R@ = RECmyrec 	// Globals use the heap (I would prefer if the language had <span class="caps">GLOBAL</span> to specify global varsfor symmetry/clarity)<br />
        			// this version of the creation syntax does not make it obvious that allocation is taking place here</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>

      </description>
      <source:markdown>I have always thought that BBCBASIC needed records.

RTR’s BASICs have Structures, but the syntax doesn’t really feel native to BBCBASIC.

I have been a fan of Wirth’s Oberon with type extension of records as it is a clean simple concept.

Most OO languages go off into the weeds with very complex and subtle features that are not really needed for 99% of programs.

I have outlined a possible syntax/semantics for a simplified OOP style record structure description below.

Let me know what you think.

OUTLINE OF CONCEPT:

Defininng a record type

No Args (fixed size)

&#62; DEF RECmyrec
&#62;
&#62; A% // Integer field
&#62;
&#62; B // Floating field
&#62;
&#62; C$ // String field
&#62;
&#62; D@ // Pointer field (any RECxxx) initial value NULL
&#62;
&#62; DIM E% 1024 // Raw byte block field 1kB inline in record, use with indirection operators
&#62;
&#62; DIM F%(9) // Array of 10 ints
&#62;
&#62; DIM G(9) // Array of 10 floats
&#62;
&#62; DIM H$(9) // Array of 10 strings
&#62;
&#62; DIM I@(9) // Array of 10 pointer to record initial value NULL
&#62;
&#62; ENDREC

With Args (variable size and initial values)

&#62; DEF RECmyvarrec(n$,m%,blocksize%)
&#62;
&#62; name$ = n$ // Initialise value
&#62;
&#62; DIM list$(m%) // n+1 strings – record contains a pointer to the array
&#62;
&#62; DIM block% blocksize%\*2+38 // can do calculations; specifies number of bytes, numbered 0 to result-1
&#62;
&#62; ENDREC

Global or Private

&#62; R@ = RECmyrec // Globals use the heap (I would prefer if the language had GLOBAL to specify global varsfor symmetry/clarity)
&#62;
&#62; // this version of the creation syntax does not make it obvious that allocation is taking place here

&#62; GLOBAL R@ = RECmyrec // opt global designator

&#62; R@ = NEW RECobject // alternetive syntax choice for creating a new record, makes it explicit that record allocation is taking place.

&#62; PRIVATE T@ = NEW RECmyrec // PRIVATEs use the heap. Same as PRIVATE in RTRBBCBASIC

STATIC — used for “class variables/methods” see below

I prefer the use of NEW rather than DIM because DIM is already used for Arrays and Structures

Stack (LOCAL vars)

&#62; LOCAL S@ = NEW RECmyvarrec(“Bob”,9,256) // Locals also use the heap because we will often export the reference from the scope expecting the record to persist.

When LOCAL pointer variable goes out of scope, the pointer on the stack is deleted, but the record (on heap) remains and may cause memory leaks,

CLEANUP should be used periodically.

If it is known that the record is no longer needed, it should be deleted before it goes out of scope.

The interpreter could detect escaping references and delete those that don’t, this can be complex with subtle errors, so manual or GC is easier.

Alternatively use Reference Counting (simpler, but risks memory leaks)

Delete Records and Release Heap Memory (manual GC)

&#62; DEL p@ — frees the storage fields (strings, arrays, blocks) then frees the record, does NOT follow pointer fields.

&#62; CLEANUP — executed outside any PROC or FN, marks all records reachable via global and private pointer variables then sweeps unmarked heap, does NOT follow pointers stored in Raw byte data blocks.

Method:

Add all global &#38; static pointers to the keep queue

While keep queue not empty

….Pull the next pointer from the keep queue as current record

….If current record not marked

……..Add all pointers to records to the keep queue

……..Mark current record for retention

Sweep the record heap freeing all unmarked records using the DEL operation above.

&#62; DELREC q@ — as DEL above, BUT it also follows pointer chains deleting all linked records, does NOT follow pointers stored in Raw byte data blocks.

Method:

Add q@ to the delete queue

While delete queue not empty

….Pull the next pointer from the delete queue as current record

….If current record not marked

……..Add all pointers to the delete queue

……..Free all the storage fields

……..Mark current record for deletion

Sweep the record heap freeing all marked records

Access to fields

The field access operator is . followed by the name of a field.

&#62; name$ = P@.name$

Procedure Fields / methods

&#62; DEF RECobject
&#62;
&#62; A%
&#62;
&#62; B%
&#62;
&#62; DEF PROCmethod1(a%,b%) // LOCAL vars and params must not have the same name as a record field!
&#62;
&#62; A%=a%-b%
&#62;
&#62; B%=a%+b%
&#62;
&#62; ENDPROC
&#62;
&#62; DEF FNfunc1….
&#62;
&#62; DEF PROCmethod2……
&#62;
&#62; ENDREC

Usage of procedure fields:

&#62; R@ = NEW RECobject // alternetive syntax choice for creating a new record, makes it explicit that record allocation is taking place.
&#62;
&#62; R@.PROCmethod1(56,99)
&#62;
&#62; q = R@.FNfunc1

Record Extension and overrides

&#62; DEF RECparent(args)
&#62;
&#62; name$
&#62;
&#62; DEF PROCmethod1:ENDPROC // an empty method, calling it does nothing, acts as a placeholder for later redefinition.
&#62;
&#62; DEF PROCmethod2(blah%)
&#62;
&#62; // Some code here
&#62;
&#62; ENDPROC
&#62;
&#62; DEF PROCmethod3(blah%)
&#62;
&#62; // Some other code here
&#62;
&#62; ENDPROC
&#62;
&#62; DEF PROCmethod4:UNDEFINED:ENDPROC — an undefined method placeholder, calling it throws an error, must redefine, like abstract in other languages.
&#62;
&#62; ENDREC

&#62; DEF RECchild1(args) EXTEND RECparent(arg exprs) // allows inherited fields to be initialised/dimensioned
&#62;
&#62; address$ // a new field
&#62;
&#62; DEF PROCmethod1 // this overrides any method with the same name, implements something for method1.
&#62;
&#62; // Do something
&#62;
&#62; ENDPROC
&#62;
&#62; // PROCmethod2 is not defined here, so the one from the parent is inherited.
&#62;
&#62; DEF PROCmethod3(blah%) // overrides PROCmethod3
&#62;
&#62; // Do this
&#62;
&#62; PARENT.PROCmethod3(blah%+8) — here we call PROCmethod3 from the parent.
&#62;
&#62; // Do That
&#62;
&#62; ENDPROC
&#62;
&#62; DEF PROCmethod4 // this defines PROCmethod4 for the first time.
&#62;
&#62; // Do something. Calling PARENT.method4 here throws an error (default halt program)
&#62;
&#62; ENDPROC
&#62;
&#62; ENDREC

PARENT

// passes control to an overridden method, that method may have been inherited through several levels of extension, it will activate the last matching definition.

THIS

// refers to the current object within a method, it is implied when accessing fields within methods.

TYPE$

// refers to the type of a record as a string e.g. “RECchild1”

TYPE

// refers to the type of the record internal representation, can be used for type tests

&#62; IF THIS.TYPE = RECchild1 THEN …

TYPE and TYPE$ work on any pointer variable as well. to allow type comparisons (compare 2 pointers or pointer against TYPE value):

&#62; IF R@.TYPE = P@.TYPE // do they have the same dynamic type?
&#62;
&#62; IF R@.TYPE &#60;\&#62; RECsometype // R@ is NOT pointing to a RECsometype?
&#62;
&#62; IF R@.TYPE \&#62; P@.TYPE // is R@ pointing to a supertype of P@?
&#62;
&#62; IF R@.TYPE &#62;= P@.TYPE // is R@ the same OR a supertype of P@?
&#62;
&#62; IF R@.TYPE &#60; RECparent // is R@ a subtype of RECparent?
&#62;
&#62; IF R@.TYPE &#60;= RECparent // is R@ the same as or a subtype of RECparent?

Calling an undefined method is a fatal error and will halt the program.

Fields are not redefined/overridden and must only be named once in an extension chain.

There is no multiple inheritance, interfaces, generics as these are complex and hard to do correctly.

Managing Namespace Pollution and example of “class” var/method

If a program has a large number of record types with lots of internal fields and methods that the user of the record does not need to touch the interface becomes a confusing mess.

Most OOP languages allow marking fields and methods as private/public, etc

I propose that for the BASIC extension above that all fields and methods are private by default and only visible inside the REC structure and by any child REC that extends from it.

To make things visible to the program at large, fields and methods are marked with an export mark ‘&#60;-’

&#62; DEF RECobject
&#62;
&#62; &#60;\- A% // A% is visible to the whole program as MyPtr@.A%
&#62;
&#62; B% // B% is only visible to methods inside RECobject fatal error to attempt access outside.
&#62;
&#62; &#60;\- STATIC C% // this is global to all instances of RECobject
&#62;
&#62; &#60;\- DEF PROCmethod1(a%,b%) // Can be called anywhere as MyPtr@.PROCmethod1(…)
&#62;
&#62; A%=a%-b%
&#62;
&#62; B%=a%+b%
&#62;

The exported API of this REC is:

&#62;
&#62; &#60;\- STATICDEF PROCdouble // affects all instances, can be called without any live instance
&#62;
&#62; ENDREC

Example usage outside the definition

RECobject.C% = 5 // set the class var C% to 5 for all RECobjects

R@ = NEW RECobject

R@.PROCmethod1(20,10)

PRINT R@.A% // prints 10

R@.PROCmethod2

PRINT R@.A% // prints 5

DEL R@ // delete the record

RECobject.PROCdouble // there are no live instances at this time

p@ = NEW RECobject

p@.PROCmethod1(100, 15)

PRINT p@.A% // prints 85

p@.PROCmethod2

PRINT p@.A% // prints 10, as C% was doubled by PROCdouble

DEL p@ // delete the record

Many thanks Andy and everyone who replied, that was so simple and now CPUClock controls my CM4 temperature.

&#62; my machine is clocked at 2200MHz.

George I have increased my clock speed from 2 GHz to 2.1GHz, I am not quite brave enough at the moment to go all the way to 2.2GHz.

Finally, many thanks to all the brave pioneers who five years ago, helped develop the CM4 into the great device it is today.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Quite a slow session today; lots of chatter about other things, but also a lot of explaining why I’ve planned things the way that I have, and how I’m doing this work.

The repository – [riscos-wimp-templates](https://github.com/gerph/riscos-wimp-templates) – has a simple build and CI environment that tests things. We can open a file and close it – that’s pretty much it. But I’ve also created a simple module that lets us call the SWIs that are defined.

The modules, such as they are, can be found in the [riscos64-status](https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status) repository, as usual.

Interestingly, at the end, I used \`PicoC\` to perform the test on RISC OS 64, as there isn’t a useful 64bit RISC OS BASIC on there – I never got around to making the SDLBASIC do SWI calls properly.

Next week, I’ll be continuing, I think. Working on the Window and Icon decoding from the templates.</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Last year I spent many ‘happy’ months writing these short guides. Having taught English abroad for 13 years I learned the hazards of ‘teacher talk’ and as you can see these volumes contain only code, with some image \[usually of what the code produces on screen\], but without the usual waffle most other programming books contain.

The title ‘The Happy Hacker’ was inspired by a song of the same name written by Chris Jeffers for the Alto computer over at Xerox PARC. \[ [https://soundcloud.com/audimprove/happy-hacker](https://soundcloud.com/audimprove/happy-hacker) and [https://vimeo.com/111334072](https://vimeo.com/111334072)\].

Last week I reviewed all of the code and came up with one small improvement:

Rotate {Volume 1, page 12}

…

REPEAT

MOUSE x,y,button

…

ELSE

WAIT &#60;———-add this to smooth rotation!

PROCplot\_points

PROCrotate

PROCplot\_points

ENDIF

UNTIL button &#60;&#62; 0

The original does NOT contain the ‘WAIT’ command – it still works but not smoothly.

I also made some additional content, not yet included in this Happy Hacker series, which I may include in ‘Volume 14’ one day.

      <title>Stop The Presses - Last Minute RISCOSbits News and Special Offers</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/20073</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In last minute stop-press news, RISCOSbits are pleased to announce a few additions to the London Show stand.</p>
        <p>For those of you who are in the market for a <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS laptop, RISCOSbits may have exactly what you are looking for at the London show! We will have <span class="caps">VERY</span> <span class="caps">LIMITED</span> stock of Linux enabled, but <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS capable Pinebook Pros available for sale at the London show. Whilst these laptops are not fitted with <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS for licencing reasons, we can demonstrate them running <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS to show you that it is possible and easy to do. All you will need to do is pop along to another stand at the show and purchase access to the <span class="caps">ROM</span>.</p>
        <p>As people may be aware, there are two variants of Pinebook Pro &#8211; one with a UK layout keyboard, and one with a more generic (US) layout. We will have the latter available.</p>
        <p>The Pinebook Pro comes equipped with 64GB of eMMC storage preinstalled and pre-formatted for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS use. The laptops (running Linux) will be available on a “first come, first served” basis for only £150 &#8211; remember, stocks are very limited. We also have a super bargain special offer on one with a slight donk on the top rim of the shell. Doesn&#8217;t affect the functionality, but we&#8217;ll knock a further <strong>£25 off!</strong></p>
        <p>Our next bit of <strong>exclusive</strong> news is we&#8217;ll be selling external antennas for Compute Module 4 systems, especially those in metal cases. Many of you will be aware that the Linux method of enabling this using dtparams doesn&#8217;t work on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS, but by partnering with Stader Software, we are able to offer exclusive free access to antenna control software for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS to enable the external antenna.</p>

      <source:markdown>In last minute stop-press news, RISCOSbits are pleased to announce a few additions to the London Show stand.

For those of you who are in the market for a RISC OS laptop, RISCOSbits may have exactly what you are looking for at the London show! We will have VERYLIMITED stock of Linux enabled, but RISC OS capable Pinebook Pros available for sale at the London show. Whilst these laptops are not fitted with RISC OS for licencing reasons, we can demonstrate them running RISC OS to show you that it is possible and easy to do. All you will need to do is pop along to another stand at the show and purchase access to the ROM.

As people may be aware, there are two variants of Pinebook Pro – one with a UK layout keyboard, and one with a more generic (US) layout. We will have the latter available.

The Pinebook Pro comes equipped with 64GB of eMMC storage preinstalled and pre-formatted for RISC OS use. The laptops (running Linux) will be available on a “first come, first served” basis for only £150 – remember, stocks are very limited. We also have a super bargain special offer on one with a slight donk on the top rim of the shell. Doesn’t affect the functionality, but we’ll knock a further **£25 off!**

Our next bit of **exclusive** news is we’ll be selling external antennas for Compute Module 4 systems, especially those in metal cases. Many of you will be aware that the Linux method of enabling this using dtparams doesn’t work on RISC OS, but by partnering with Stader Software, we are able to offer exclusive free access to antenna control software for RISC OS to enable the external antenna.

As an added bonus, if you buy a system with a WiFi- enabled Compute Module 4 from our FreeNVMe or FAST range and you ask for an antenna, we’ll give it you for free, including exclusive access to the control software for RISC OS. Combine this with our ‘Get In Free\*’ [offer](https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/20069) and you’re making incredible savings! It’s also worth remembering we publish the prices and specifications of our systems on our [website](https://www.riscosbits.co.uk/systems.htm) so you can calculate the bang per buck you get with RISCOSbits!

We’ll also have a few gold and black case badges to tell the world what’s running inside your otherwise anonymous case! And at a pocket money price of only £2.50!

And the final teaser is we’ll be bringing along some delightful Welsh slate drinks mats, engraved with your favourite OS logo. Available for just £5 each, they’re sure to make your desk look oh so pretty and er, ringless. You could even buy a set of four for £18 for your coffee table or home cocktail bar!

So ‘coast’ on over to our stand to grab yours!</source:markdown>

        	</ul><p>At the recent Show Preview user group meeting, Andrew Rawnsley of <span class="caps">RCI</span> <br />
        demonstrated some new hardware items that had been proving popular this <br />
        summer, and will be available at the London Show this weekend.</p>
        <p>18 inches of RISCBook<br />
        =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=</p>
        <p>First up was a new 18&quot; RISCBook laptop.  For those unfamiliar, the <br />
        RISCBook range of laptops run <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS and Windows together, providing the <br />
        best of both <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS and Windows software, with links between the two OSs <br />
        to allow them to share resources such as files, printers, clipboard, and <br />
        networking.</p>
        <p>The pressing onset of Windows 11 has prompted a number of users to upgrade <br />
        this Autumn, and the 18&quot; laptop has proven popular.  Although 18&quot; may <br />
        sound huge for a laptop, screen shapes have become more flexible in recent <br />
        times, and the 18&quot; uses a 16:10 ratio with more vertical space for <br />
        documents.  This means it is roughly the same size/weight as a 17&quot; laptop, <br />
        whilst offering more screen space (1920&#215;1200).  Very practical for working <br />
        on documents, and the high refresh rate (144 Hz) <span class="caps">IPS</span> panel looks lovely.</p>
        <p>We&#8217;ve found that as people age, they appreciate the larger screens and <br />
        full size backlit keyboards (with number pads), whilst finding the <br />
        convenience of a laptop is easier to fit in various rooms.  For example, <br />
        RCI&#8217;s Allan (Andrew&#8217;s father) now uses his laptop downstairs to save <br />
        having to trek up to the more traditional machines in his office upstairs.</p>
        <p>Whilst the laptops aren&#8217;t <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS friendly when they arrive, <span class="caps">RCI</span> is able <br />
        to adapt them to run <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS beautifully, with smooth performance and <br />
        flexible software compatibility (run both 26bit and 32bit applications).</p>
        <p>Touchpad mouse gestures (eg. 3 finger tap) mean that replication of the <br />
        three button mouse is great too.  Of course, you can plug in a mouse (or <br />
        use a wireless one) too.</p>
        <p>These laptops are no slouches &#8211; 8-core, 16 thread <span class="caps">AMD</span> chips amply <br />
        demonstrate why <span class="caps">AMD</span> have become so dominant again recently &#8211; they can <br />
        motor through anything from web browsing to video editing.  Whilst the <br />
        graphics are on-chip, they&#8217;re top tier for what they are, making games <br />
        possible too.  With 16GB <span class="caps">RAM</span> and 1TB of storage packed into a slim and <br />
        low-weight chassis, there&#8217;s a lot of &#8220;oomph&#8221; inside.</p>
        <p>Of course, <span class="caps">RCI</span> offers a range of other RISCBooks too, from 13&quot; upwards <br />
        with a variety of screens including <span class="caps">OLED</span>.  However, these 18&quot; units have <br />
        proven quite popular, and so we&#8217;re singling them out to <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS users.  <br />
        The laptops should be on display in London.  Expect to see RCI&#8217;s MiniPC <br />
        range too.</p>
        <p>Pinebook Pros<br />
        =-=-=-=-=-=-=</p>
        <p>Speaking of Laptops, <span class="caps">RCI</span> still have one or two Pinebook Pros &#8211; they grab <br />
        stock from around the world when they appear online.  Pinebook Pros offer <br />
        a fantastic native-<span class="caps">RISC</span> OS experience with class leading performance, <br />
        working wifi, and even optional NVMe sockets for high speed storage.  <br />
        Prices fluctuate as limited availability often results in price spikes, <br />
        but <span class="caps">RCI</span> is trying to keep prices in the same ballpark as before.</p>
        <p>N.Ex.T, Hydra and NVMe<br />

      <source:markdown>- We’ll be knocking 20ukp off all hardware items (over 50ukp) at the show.


  You don’t need to quote any adverts or phrases or claim anything special.


  Just money off for everyone :) \*\*

At the recent Show Preview user group meeting, Andrew Rawnsley of RCI

demonstrated some new hardware items that had been proving popular this

summer, and will be available at the London Show this weekend.

18 inches of RISCBook

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

First up was a new 18&#34; RISCBook laptop. For those unfamiliar, the

RISCBook range of laptops run RISC OS and Windows together, providing the

best of both RISC OS and Windows software, with links between the two OSs

to allow them to share resources such as files, printers, clipboard, and

networking.

The pressing onset of Windows 11 has prompted a number of users to upgrade

this Autumn, and the 18&#34; laptop has proven popular. Although 18&#34; may

sound huge for a laptop, screen shapes have become more flexible in recent

times, and the 18&#34; uses a 16:10 ratio with more vertical space for

documents. This means it is roughly the same size/weight as a 17&#34; laptop,

whilst offering more screen space (1920×1200). Very practical for working

on documents, and the high refresh rate (144 Hz) IPS panel looks lovely.

We’ve found that as people age, they appreciate the larger screens and

full size backlit keyboards (with number pads), whilst finding the

convenience of a laptop is easier to fit in various rooms. For example,

RCI’s Allan (Andrew’s father) now uses his laptop downstairs to save

having to trek up to the more traditional machines in his office upstairs.

Whilst the laptops aren’t RISC OS friendly when they arrive, RCI is able

to adapt them to run RISC OS beautifully, with smooth performance and

flexible software compatibility (run both 26bit and 32bit applications).

Touchpad mouse gestures (eg. 3 finger tap) mean that replication of the

three button mouse is great too. Of course, you can plug in a mouse (or

use a wireless one) too.

These laptops are no slouches – 8-core, 16 thread AMD chips amply

demonstrate why AMD have become so dominant again recently – they can

motor through anything from web browsing to video editing. Whilst the

graphics are on-chip, they’re top tier for what they are, making games

possible too. With 16GB RAM and 1TB of storage packed into a slim and

low-weight chassis, there’s a lot of “oomph” inside.

Of course, RCI offers a range of other RISCBooks too, from 13&#34; upwards

with a variety of screens including OLED. However, these 18&#34; units have

proven quite popular, and so we’re singling them out to RISC OS users.

The laptops should be on display in London. Expect to see RCI’s MiniPC

range too.

Pinebook Pros

=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Speaking of Laptops, RCI still have one or two Pinebook Pros – they grab

stock from around the world when they appear online. Pinebook Pros offer

a fantastic native-RISC OS experience with class leading performance,

working wifi, and even optional NVMe sockets for high speed storage.

Prices fluctuate as limited availability often results in price spikes,

but RCI is trying to keep prices in the same ballpark as before.

N.Ex.T, Hydra and NVMe

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RCI will also be showing N.Ex.T and Hydra systems as usual – expect to see

large NVMe drives and some exciting new features. See the latest v9 (and

the forthcoming v10) NVMe drivers with SMART disc health features and

drive health checks. See native RISC OS disc partitions, 4K sectors, our

NVMe toolkit and more.

Hydra shows how Pi4 and Pi5 tech can be used side-by-side, and you’ll be

able to see ROD’s new RISC OS Direct for Pi5 running on a Hydra Head.

Check out the tiny mini.pi N.Ex.T computer which packs almost every

feature into the tiniest box, at a cracking price.

There will also be some rather different devices shown with up to 8 NVMe

slots! Aimed at file sharing and home NAS appliances, these small silent

boxes provide exceptional capabilities at surprisingly affordable prices,

whilst opening up a range of options for RISC OS and allowing room to

expand and grow. Come and find out more at the show.

RISCube Minis

=-=-=-=-=-=-=

We’ve talked about RISCBooks, but 2025 has also bee the year of MiniPCs

with our range of RISCube Minis offering state of the art features and

stunning performance at lower-than-ever prices. See features like the

latest USB4, multiple 4K+ displays, Wifi 6E and 7, 2.5 Gbit ethernet and

more – all useable from RISC OS!

Monitors

=-=-=-=-

We’ll have a selection of IPS and OLED displays available on the stand for

you to check out and plan the best way to make your day-to-day computing

more pleasurable. Remember your screen determines everything you see and

do on the computer, so if you’re an enthusiast (and coming to a computer

show counts as an enthusiast!) then you deserve the best you can.

Monitor prices have come down a bit recently, so why not take advantage of

that to treat yourself?

Whatever takes your fancy, come and check out our range at the RCI stand

at the show and say hello!</source:markdown>

Shows are the perfect opportunity to meet and talk to fellow RISC OS users and developers about what they’re doing with our favourite operating system.

![Show banner](/images/risc_os_open/shows/rougol2025.png)

### Venue details

A short distance by public transport, around ten miles from Heathrow airport, less than four miles from the M1 motorway, the Harrow District Masonic Centre is closer than you think; see this Google [map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vqigUNhWUqDjfXEH6) for directions.

Please note: engineering work means **the Bakerloo tube line is closed** this weekend.

### See BASIC in action

See the alpha version of BBCBASIC rewritten in C, running natively on both RISC OS 5 and Windows x64, and find out what’s required to get it all finished. It’s a considerable technical effort, and will pave the way for all kinds of language extensions in future.

Want to know why nightly builds of BASIC gained a new [SYS-as-a-function keyword](https://gitlab.riscosopen.org/RiscOS/Sources/Programmer/BASIC/-/merge_requests/16) recently? It’s all part of the [mission to the moon](/content/documents/risc-os-moonshots).</source:markdown>

        <p>NetFetch 6 costs 35ukp new, with upgrades costing 20ukp either in person or via !Store.  The new version is live now on !Store and as with its predecessor, includes free updates for the foreseeable future (6 years again?  Can&#8217;t promise, but who knows!).</p>

      <source:markdown>R-Comp are launching version 6 of NetFetch at the London show, over six years since v5.5 launched at Wakefield 2019.

(Spoiler – it’s live now on !Store)

NetFetch provides flexible mail and news fetching for RISC OS, including anti spam and other filtering capabilities, as well as a friendly front end to RISC OS internet-related software. A version of Messenger Pro is included to provide users with a “ready to use” kit.

Since the release of v5.5, email provision has changed quite substantially. Many more ISPs require enhanced security in a variety of forms – more passwords and logins, more SSL/TLS encryption, greater identity checks and so on. NetFetch 6 recognises this and has revamped its configuration to emphasise the features that modern people require. New and returning users will find that setting up NetFetch 6 is considerably improved, especially with modern ISPs.

These improvements have been brought about because internet providers such as Orpheus and Plusnet have both undergone changes recently, and whilst helping user sort out their problems, we discovered various areas that

needed to be improved or made clearer. Version six reflects these, modernising and improving the experience.

News handling has also seen a revamp, as many ISPs no longer offer newsgroup facilities. Those that do often require username/password login, so the old setup routines no longer made sense. We have now taken news out of the initial setup to streamline things, and instead introduced a new Assistant to guide people through setting up free newsgroup access regardless of ISP. By following the built-in assistant, and filling out two boxes, you’ll be able to get newsgroup access set up whenever you’re ready. Meanwhile, existing users will appreciate clearer settings, and easy support for both server login and SSL/TLS.

Speaking of encryption, v6 sees support added for the latest TLS 1.3 standard including handshake-level identity checks. These are conducted as part of the TLS connection to prove you are who you say you are – something that we have seen mandated on real-world “big company” TLS 1.3 servers.

NetFetch 6 will be available as a paid-for upgrade to existing customers, launching at the London show, but anyone who has purchased v5.5 this year (2025) can claim a free upgrade by specifying their purchase date when

ordering. Version 6 will be available in person at the show and via !Store download.

NetFetch 6 costs 35ukp new, with upgrades costing 20ukp either in person or via !Store. The new version is live now on !Store and as with its predecessor, includes free updates for the foreseeable future (6 years again? Can’t promise, but who knows!).

        <p>Designed from the ground up to fit perfectly with existing <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS filesystems, FreeNVMe follows all the usual filecore conventions so that all existing tools, such as DiscKnight, work straight out of the box &#8211; no custom tools are required.</p>
        <p>A conscious decision was made to adopt the existing standards for filing systems, so that any developments to the core of <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS would automatically integrate with FreeNVMe.</p>

        	<li>Works on Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 systems</li>

        	<li>Dual format drives with separate icons for each format.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And FreeNVMe is <span class="caps">FAST</span>! So fast that we felt comfortable incorporating it into our premium range of computers without any hidden charges.</p>
        <p><strong>What&#8217;s New</strong><br />
        In our latest developments, rather than chasing irrelevant numbers, we&#8217;ve been focusing on real-world usability and integration – from more reliable file handling and faster boot times to improved support for large storage volumes and smoother performance under pressure. At the show, you’ll be able to see how NVMe, when properly harnessed, makes <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS feel more modern, stable, and capable than ever before. We&#8217;ve also improved drive compatibility to near 100%  &#8211; there&#8217;ll always be rogue drives, but we&#8217;ve even built in a system to manage them.</p>
        <p>We don&#8217;t need to make strangely calculated claims about how it compares to other products &#8211; we just give it to you for nothing so you can make your own mind up!</p>]]>

      <source:markdown>\*it’s okay, ROUGOL, we’re not sneaking people in through a side entrance!

To celebrate the first show outing of our updated and very latest release of FreeNVMe genuinely open source drivers, RISCOSbits are offering to refund people’s entrance fee, by way of an extra discount on all purchases of NVMe-enabled pre-built systems at our stand.

Terms and conditions obviously apply (we’ll only offer one refund per customer) but we’re happy if you get together with a RISC OS friend and send your mate up to buy another NVMe system on your behalf to get a second discount!

Simply quote ‘Oi! Gimme my door money back’ when making your purchase and we’ll knock it off the price!

**About FreeNVMe**

FreeNVMe is the next generation of fully Open Source RISC OS storage technology and it’s completely free!

As the result of partnering with Stader Softwareentwicklung and RISC OS Open, RISCOSbits have been instrumental in developing, and further updating, the free and fully Open Source NVMe driver and filing system, that we first demonstrated way back in December 2023. And it has been in reliable use on RISCOSbits’ Compute Module 4 systems ever since.

Designed from the ground up to fit perfectly with existing RISC OS filesystems, FreeNVMe follows all the usual filecore conventions so that all existing tools, such as DiscKnight, work straight out of the box – no custom tools are required.

A conscious decision was made to adopt the existing standards for filing systems, so that any developments to the core of RISC OS would automatically integrate with FreeNVMe.

There’s no tie-in to a paid-for support scheme – our driver is designed to work with the nightly builds from RISC OS Open. And it’s completely free. You can download it now, without having to buy a system, an NVMe drive or anything else:

[www.riscosbits.co.uk/nvme/](http://www.riscosbits.co.uk/nvme/)

[https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/raspberry…](https://www.riscosopen.org/content/downloads/raspberry-pi)

And FreeNVMe is genuinely open source. You can look at, and download, the source code directly from the RISC OS Open repository NOW. You have the opportunity to contribute to the code to improve FreeNVMe and make it into the real community-led filing system it was intended to be.

FreeNVMe is designed to offer the following features as standard:

- Works on Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 systems
- 4Kn sectors to allow for drives up to 2TB
- Partitioning via freely available software
- DiscKnight compatibility
- Standard file system icon (no separate app needed)
- Dual format drives with separate icons for each format.

And FreeNVMe is FAST! So fast that we felt comfortable incorporating it into our premium range of computers without any hidden charges.

**What’s New**

In our latest developments, rather than chasing irrelevant numbers, we’ve been focusing on real-world usability and integration – from more reliable file handling and faster boot times to improved support for large storage volumes and smoother performance under pressure. At the show, you’ll be able to see how NVMe, when properly harnessed, makes RISC OS feel more modern, stable, and capable than ever before. We’ve also improved drive compatibility to near 100% – there’ll always be rogue drives, but we’ve even built in a system to manage them.

We don’t need to make strangely calculated claims about how it compares to other products – we just give it to you for nothing so you can make your own mind up!</source:markdown>

      <title>PhotoDesk 3.25 released</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/20065</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce that version 3.25 of PhotoDesk is now available to download for existing users via !Store.</p>
        <p>Following on from 3.24&#8217;s colossal number of changes, 3.25 is a much smaller affair, correcting a few things that slipped through and have been reported since:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>&#8220;click_in_rotate&#8221; routine called &#8220;click_in_draw&#8221; with the incorrect number of paramters.  Now fixed.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        	<li>Resize and Rotate functions had Bi-cubic and Bi-linear modes swapped.  Expected operation has been restored.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        	<li><span class="caps">PNG</span> files were being saved without compression, leading to very large files.  Since <span class="caps">PNG</span> compression is lossless, this was not sensible, so PNGs are now compressed as you&#8217;d expect.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The update is available as a free download for anyone who purchased the <span class="caps">XAT</span> edition (3.18+) of PhotoDesk some years ago.</p>
        <p>We will have a number of fresh CDs with 3.25 on at the London Show this weekend.  We offer them as very low cost &#8220;stocking stuffers&#8221; for existing users.  The CDs contain extra software (3.25 adds Chris Terran&#8217;s GradGrind palette editor designed for use with PhotoDesk) that wouldn&#8217;t fit in the regular download, plus extras like full sets of example images and documentation etc.</p>
        <p>If you don&#8217;t have a CD drive, bring a <span class="caps">USB</span> stick (we do sell them, but they tend to be larger ones) and we&#8217;ll copy the CD contents onto the stick for you.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce that RISCOSbits will be exhibiting at the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS London Show on Saturday, 25th October 2025. As a continuation of our commitment to providing high-quality, great value and innovative <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS systems, we’re bringing along a full range of new and improved products for users of all levels—from casual tinkerers to serious power users.</p>
        <p>You’ll be able to get hands-on with our most advanced systems to date, including the blazingly fast <span class="caps">FIRE</span> systems with capacity for up to four full speed <span class="caps">SATA</span> SSDs (potentially 8TB of <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS format storage!), our sleek and compact <span class="caps">VENOM</span>, eNVY.Me and PiRO Qube NVMe machines.</p>
        <p>You&#8217;ll also be able to get your hands on one of our new <span class="caps">FAST</span> NVMe XL systems, upgraded to 8GB of useable <span class="caps">RAM</span>! Good luck trying to use all that!</p>
        <p><strong>The <span class="caps">DIY</span> Range</strong><br />
        We’re also excited to show off our <span class="caps">DIY</span> product range &#8211; a collection of hands-on kits that let you build your very own <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS computer. Whether you’re a seasoned hardware builder or just fancy getting under the hood, there’s something here for you.</p>
        <p>Our entry-level system offers a compact 85mm x 110mm design, powered by a 2GHz <span class="caps">CPU</span> and 2GB <span class="caps">RAM</span>, with 128GB NVMe storage and a 32GB SD card to run <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS from. It’s simple, snappy, and just £119 &#8211; a great way to get started.</p>
        <p>For those who want a little more flexibility, our mid-range kit expands to a 140mm x 120mm footprint and includes a more versatile selection of ports, 32GB of eMMC storage, 128GB of NVMe storage and <span class="caps">USB</span>-C and barrel jack power options &#8211; ideal for more advanced projects, priced at £179.</p>
        <p>At the top end of the range is our <span class="caps">DIY</span> powerhouse system, featuring a 2.2GHz <span class="caps">CPU</span>, 4GB <span class="caps">RAM</span>, 32GB eMMC, a 256GB NVMe drive, and a custom designed wooden case that you can finish and personalise yourself. It’s the ideal choice for users who want customisability without sacrificing power or style, available for £199.</p>
        <p>All kits come with pre-configured software, essential components, clear instructions, and zero soldering required. Just add your own screwdriver &#8211; and maybe a cup of tea!</p>
        <p>For more details, see our new website at <a href="http://www.riscosbits.co.uk">www.riscosbits.co.uk</a></p>
        <p><strong>Showcases at <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS London</strong><br />
        We’ll also be lifting the lid on two exciting new developments currently in the works. First up is a brand new dual-OS computer system, mini.<span class="caps">BOB</span>. This little beast synergises the best hardware elements of Linux and <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS into one seriously powerful unit, all within a tidy, ultra-small footprint case. If you&#8217;ve ever dreamed of a seamless crossover between two platforms in a compact and efficient package, this might just be it.</p>
        <p>We’ll be demonstrating the results of our ongoing work in enhancing NVMe functionality across the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS platform. Rather than just chasing numbers, we’ve been focusing on real-world usability and integration &#8211; from more reliable file handling and faster boot times to improved support for large storage volumes and smoother performance under pressure. At the show, you’ll be able to see how NVMe, when properly harnessed, makes <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS feel more modern, stable, and capable than ever before.</p>
        <p>We&#8217;ll have our custom wood panelled <span class="caps">ITX</span> cases available to take away. In either 5 litre or 8 litre capacity, these beautiful little cases make your otherwise anonymous systems really stand out. Designed as a <span class="caps">DIY</span> kit, they come as both a fully matt acrylic case or one with wooden front and top panels, also adding a two port <span class="caps">USB</span> header converter. Ideal for CM4IO based systems.</p>
        <p>And if you want a flash but quality keyboard for your <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS needs, we&#8217;ll have some on sale that will literally flash &#8211; if you ask them to!</p>
        <p>With individually backlit near silent Cherry Red MX keys, you can emulate the Retro look of an A3000. And with a few keystrokes, an A3010!  That&#8217;s right, you can colour each individual key to whatever colour you want.</p>
        <p>And, of course, we’ve got a couple of other developments we’ve been quietly refining in the background &#8211; ideas and innovations that have kept us excited at RISCOSbits HQ, and we can’t wait to share. Maybe even a throwback to 2005, &#8220;adjusted&#8221; for the modern 32bit world.</p>
        <p>We&#8217;ll be showing off, for you to order on the day at special Show prices, our <span class="caps">ECOS</span> and ECOfile range of companion systems, to enhance your <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS experience by using the best of other OSes.</p>
        <p>We’ll also have a selection of clearance stock at bargain prices, some lovely stickers and badges, also available at special low prices. Plus a few other decorative items that we&#8217;ll share in due course.</p>
        <p>Whether you&#8217;re a long-time <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS veteran or completely new to the scene, the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS London Show is the perfect opportunity to see the latest developments, chat with us, and explore what RISCOSbits has to offer. We’re excited to bring something for everyone—and we look forward to seeing you in Harrow!</p>]]>

I wrote USBJoystick, however it is only suitable for ‘native’ RISC OS hardware – not emulators. It talks to the built-in USB stack in RISC OS 5 and maps HID devices to the old Acorn joystick API. So if you had, for example, a Raspberry Pi running RISC OS, then you could plug in a USB controller, and it would ‘just work’.

      <source:markdown>There is a thread over on stardot regarding getting an ADF10 Econet module to work on a UNIPOD, it presents anecdotal evidence that this been done successfully before but evidently lost without trace.

[https://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=29655](https://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=29655)

I have long wondered about that and in a moment of weakness decided to have a look at it.

SO far I have taken the Econet module source from the IOMD build of RISC OS 5 from my RasPi over to a SA RPC with a unipod, and up to date ROOLDDE, where I can build it out of the RISC OS source tree by dropping its make file into amu.

This results in several targets RMs including Econet, EconetSA &#38; EconetD. The EconetSA module works on anther SA RPC with an Acorn AEH60 Econet module, so that’s a good start at any rate.

In the source I can see quite a lot of extra debugging output, particularly around scanning the podules for the right one, an area that I need to rework first. But running EconetD does not result in any debugging output, and nor actually are any of the strings I can see in this code present in the binary.

I have not used objasm before and never explored this mire of macros.

I can see in code section below what appears to be conditional assembly dependent on ‘DebugFindHardware’

FindPoduleLoop

DECS r3

BMI AddressUnknown

\[ DebugFindHardware

BREG r3, “Podule\_ReadInfo: R3 = &#38;”

\]

Push “r10, r11, r14”

MOV r0, #Podule\_ReadInfo\_SyncBase + Podule\_ReadInfo\_ID + Podule\_ReadInfo\_Type

MOV r1, sp

MOV r2, #3\*4

SWI XPodule\_ReadInfo

Pull “r10, r11, r14”

\[ DebugFindHardware

DREG r10, “Synchronous base address = &#38;”

BREG r11, “ID = &#38;”

DREG r14, “Type = &#38;”

\]

BVS FindPoduleLoop

BIC r11, r11, #2\_101 ; Knock out FIQ/IRQ request bits

TEQ r11, #SimpleType\_Econet:SHL:3

BEQ AddressKnown

TEQ r11, #SimpleType\_Extended:SHL:3

TEQEQ r14, #ProdType\_Econet

BEQ AddressKnown

B FindPoduleLoop

AddressUnknown

LDR r10, =EconetController ; Default for internal hardware

AddressKnown

\[ DebugFindHardware

DREG r10, “Address we are using = &#38;”

\]

I can see that ‘DebugFindHardware’ appears to be set in this line but I am not making any sense of it:

DebugFindHardware SETL (:LNOT: ReleaseVersion) :LAND: {FALSE}

The make file does not seem to hint at how debug options are set either.

What am I missing here?

      <source:markdown>I’m pleased to announce the release of Today version 3.20. The application lists events that have taken place (or will take place) on a given date. It contains a database of historical information, to which additional dates and personal anniversaries can be added.

![](https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/data/software/today/screen1.jpg)

Originally written by James Miskin, I produced a 32-bit update in 2006. Almost 20 years later, following a question at RISC OS North back in March, I went on a hunt for the source code, dusted it off, and have produced a new version with the following changes:

- The application has been built with a toolchain known to be ARMv7 compatible.
- There is now a Help… entry in the main and iconbar menus.
- The date shown in the scan window is updated when the system clock changes day, so long as the window was previously on the current day.
- The upper bound for the day of the month is correctly set when opening the event window.
- A minimum window size is applied when setting the extent of the scan and search windows, to avoid the search results being hidden.

A copy of version 3.20 can be found on my website, at [https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/today](https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/today). It has also been added — finally — to the PlingStore, and if I’ve managed to find the correct incantations it should also show up in PackMan over the next few days.

Originally released into the Public Domain by James, I have applied version 1.2 of the EUPL to the new release to make its status clear, and the source code can finally be found amongst my other projects on GitHub at [https://github.com/steve-fryatt/today](https://github.com/steve-fryatt/today)</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>&#62; if your audience would find it easier to do something another way, and you actively choose to do something different… then you are failing your audience.

If we take that statement literally then almost everything in RISC OS, old and new, could be seen as “failing” the audience. For example, people have been asking for easier development environments or multi-core support for years, and those needs are still unmet (and after sponsoring 2.5M GBP they still will be unmet apparently!).

That said, I do think Steve has a point.

If someone wanted to organise an online-only event (say a “RISC OS Xmas online show”), I am sure plenty of us could contribute material. The format would mostly be one-way, with prepared videos or live presentations and only limited feedback.

In-person shows, in contrast, work very differently. From my own experience, I get much more direct feedback and can respond to exactly what people are interested in. It also allows for spontaneous conversations that just do not happen online. On Zoom, only one person can really speak at a time, and asking questions in front of a whole audience may not suit everyone.

For example, at the last Bristol show I attended, I was constantly busy with people asking questions, and once the initial “ice” was broken, I had some really valuable and enjoyable conversations. That kind of interaction is very hard to replicate online.

So to me, the two experiences serve different purposes. Online events are valuable, but they cannot replace in-person shows. Even for those of us doing free software rather than running businesses, I think the in-person format offers something unique.

Hence I don’t think the in-person shows are “failing their audience”, I think they are fine and having only two in-person shows per year seems to be a good number given the slow pass in developments that are happening on RISC OS (it’s an old platform and it takes time to build stuff on it). There might be space for an on-line event for who cannot attend the in-person event.

For what concern discussing users issues, I think user-group meetings are still way more valuable (either in person or on-line), given the focus of such meetings.</source:markdown>

        	<li>A new *-command has been added to allow easier debugging of the variables that have been set.</li>
        	<li>Simple tests added to check the type, length and returned values from the SWIs have been added. These are run during the CI.</li>
        	<li>Fortify is now present in the build, checking that the memory has all been freed (and the memory leaks have been fixed).</li>

      <source:markdown>I&#39;ve been working on Ovation Pro to add extra scaling options to the picture proxy setting. For those who attended my @rougol.bsky.social talk, I explained the use of proxy images. Base/16, Base/32 &#38; Base/64 now offer even smaller proxies, making for smaller document sizes.

I was using the emulator, maybe that has something to do with the hanging, haven&#8217;t tried on a RPi yet. I found out that the <span class="caps">DDE</span> C++ Toolbox library I&#8217;m writing had some missing gadgets as I had used the Toolbox documentation. Tabs, ScrollList and TreeView are not included. Returned from holiday so I&#8217;m gradually adding them to the library.</p>]]>

        <p>I can understand the attraction of using pCloud directly from <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. But failing that, if you have a <span class="caps">NAS</span>, it may be poossible to get the <span class="caps">NAS</span> to connect to pCloud, and then use LanMan98 or <span class="caps">NFS</span> to access it from <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS until CloudFS is revived.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I actually use this approach anyway now. The reality is this approach also boost performance. I let my Linux box do the sync up in the background, while local share is ultra fast like this and has another advantage, as soon as my ShareFS for Linux is completed and working, I&#8217;ll &#8220;re-share&#8221; my pCloud via ShareFS Server, which means pCLoud for old <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 3 on the Archie as well! ;)</p>
        <p>So the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS pCloud client is useful only to who has not a 3rd party Linux box in their network.</p>
        <p>Just my 0.5c.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I’ve taken a couple of embedded projects from ARM32 to AArch64. The biggest time sinks weren’t the compiler, but hidden 32-bit assumptions: pointer math in ints, varargs, packed structs, and unions. Rewriting inline asm and aligning to the AAPCS64 calling convention was unavoidable. What helped most was harsh warnings, UBSan/ASan in tests, and swapping types to size_t/uintptr_t early. For legacy apps we used a small thunk layer and kept a 32-bit build running until parity.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Live coding today was another success&#8230;</p>
        <p>There&#8217;s now a Git repository on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-systemvars">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-systemvars</a>) stub module for SystemVars, which allows simple strings to be stored in a dictionary and retrieved. There are some simple SWIs implemented that allow the interface to be exercised. The module also has CI to ensure that the build and loading of the module is successful &#8211; and there&#8217;s a small test to exercise the internals.</p>
        <p>As usual, if anyone has any questions, comments or even code suggestions and PRs, please fire them this way.</p>]]>

      <title>RISC OS 64bit work status</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/13/topics/20027</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Quick status update on the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 progress, since I posted last&#8230;</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The links on the repository have been updated with pages for individual modules, listing the features that those modules need to have and their current status.</li>
        	<li>I&#8217;m happy with my implementation of the Debugger module now, and the live coding for that has finished. It&#8217;s not quite as functional as the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac version / the riscos-disassemble Python package, but it&#8217;s working ok for me.</li>
        	<li>New `Conversions` module implementation which works.</li>
        	<li>Most of the `Convert*` modules have now been built, though not tested in 64bit (they&#8217;re not really important at this stage, but it&#8217;s good to know they build!</li>
        	<li>The `IconBorders` modules all build just fine.</li>
        	<li>Problems I had with `RemotePrinterSupport` have now been fixed and it builds in 64bit.</li>
        	<li>`ResourceFS` stub module is now complete, and obviously doesn&#8217;t do much yet.</li>
        	<li>`VideoTTX`, `VideoGuard` and `MimeMap` built for 64bit, although they&#8217;re not tested and probably won&#8217;t quite do what&#8217;s expected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And internally I&#8217;ve been updating my build environment to better handle certain cases that weren&#8217;t working previously.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Build service now has the ability to enable faster builds, using the host version of the tools &#8211; see <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/741270">https://asciinema.org/a/741270</a> for a simple run.</li>
        	<li>Improved integration within the SublimeText editor &#8211; pressing command-B can now build things with <span class="caps">AMU</span> locally and highlight the errors inline in the file, or with the build service.</li>
        	<li>Improvements to CMunge for 64bit interfaces that weren&#8217;t quite right, and the -zerrors switch, that I had recently broken.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The most recent test run says that most of the modules and tools that are present in the repository at least load correctly:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/actions/runs/17814204760">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/actions/runs/…</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The progress for Phase 1 is looking pretty good now, with many components exceeding the original aims for this phase. Still 17 falling short, but they&#8217;re probably going to be reletively easy to get to an appropriate state.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Progress">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Progress</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>And the SystemVars module is one of those modules that I will be moving on to in the Live Coding sessions. I suspect this will be relatively easy to deal with, but there will almost certainly be some special cases to handle.</p>
        <p>Anyhow that&#8217;s where things are for me. You can always follow the repositories to see what&#8217;s being done.</p>
        <p>Again, if anyone wants to contribute to these, please speak up.</p>]]>

      <title>Debugger module release</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/20025</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Over the course of the last 19 live coding sessions, I have produced a Debugger module which supports many of the things that we expect on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. We support&#8230;</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><code>*Memory</code></li>
        	<li><code>*MemoryI</code></li>
        	<li><code>*MemoryA</code></li>
        	<li><code>*DumpI</code></li>
        	<li><code>*InitStore</code></li>
        	<li><code>*ShowRegs</code></li>
        	<li><code>*BreakSet</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*BreakClr</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*BreakList</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*Debug</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*Continue</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_Disassemble</code></li>
        	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_DisassembleThumb</code></li>
        	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_DisassembleArch</code> (for AArch32 <span class="caps">ARM</span> and Thumb, and for AArch64 instructions)</li>
        	<li>AArch32 instructions are disassembled (default for regular <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS), including the <span class="caps">FPA</span> instructions.</li>
        	<li>AArch64 instructions are disassembled (default for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li>The module is built and released automatically through CI on GitHub – <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases</a></li>
        	<li>There’s a project board to record what needs to be done – <a href="https://github.com/users/gerph/projects/1">https://github.com/users/gerph/projects/1</a></li>
        	<li>The module can be built, and runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS.</li>
        	<li>The module is tested with test code derived from the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac test suites &#8211; automatically within CI.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The module has been demonstrated and run on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS in RPCEmu with !Zap and works as you might expect.</p>
        <p>The module can be obtained from the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Debugger GitHub site &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases</a></p>
        <hr />
        <p>The purpose of the Live Coding sessions was &#8211; initially &#8211; so that I could get some practice at doing coding in a different environment, and demonstrating how some techniques and skills can be used. I was hoping that it would be an encouragement to others that things which seem complicated are largely just a set of small steps to address a problem.</p>
        <p>The Debugger module was intended to be a &#8216;simple&#8217; example of how porting something useful to <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS can be done. It wasn&#8217;t quite so simple &#8211; there&#8217;s been work in shell, in python, in perl, and assembler and converting from C99 to C89. And working with someone else&#8217;s code which I didn&#8217;t understand at first. I hope that it has given people some encouragement to try doing things they wouldn&#8217;t have. I hope that it has also shown that mistakes are many and plentiful &#8211; and we roll with them. It&#8217;s also shown how bad my typing is!</p>
        <p>It&#8217;s been very exciting. I&#8217;ve laughed a lot. And along the way there&#8217;s been a number of people coming into the chat and watching the sessions without knowing anything about <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. People who asked questions &#8211; even if they&#8217;re not on the topic of the debugger &#8211; and have been very friendly. That&#8217;s been a nice experience too.</p>
        <p>So it&#8217;s been quite successful, and has produced a replacement module in C for an existing module. Feel free to raise bugs in GitHub, and PRs will be happily received if they&#8217;re incremental and reviewable.</p>]]>

      <title>Live Coding with Gerph, Sunday 14th September at 1pm</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/20019</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This was the final session on the Debugger. I&#8217;m pretty happy with the disassembler now. This final session updated the CI tests so that they (mostly) pass. There were some failures when it was finally integrated into the CI, which I decided to fix offline &#8211; they were caused by the use of a non-deterministic part of the table generation in Python. Now that it&#8217;s fixed, I think we&#8217;ve got a good version.</p>
        <p>The Debugger has been published up on the site in the releases section: <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c</a></p>
        <p>The 64bit version can be found on the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64bit status pages: <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status</a></p>

        <p>Next week, I&#8217;ll be starting on a different project &#8211; something short, I hope!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I suppose I should reply to this thread</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>My view is that if there is any wider future for “RISC OS”, it’s applying the look and feel to the 64 bit OS and applications that I and millions of others are using on Linux.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A lot of what you desire already exists, or at least a runnable foundation does.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHsHU-dDwAk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHsHU-dDwAk</a></p>
        <p>Source code here;<br />
        <a href="https://home.marutan.net/hg/riscwm">https://home.marutan.net/hg/riscwm</a></p>
        <p>Here are a few pros and cons compared;</p>
        <p>Pros</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Already runs on 64bit (arm, x64, powerpc, whatever)</li>
        	<li>Runs Linux <sup id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> apps (technically more easily than <span class="caps">ROLF</span>, as it doesn&#8217;t require apps to be recompiled/linked against a different graphics stack).</li>
        	<li>Runs <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS apps, via RPCEmu</li>
        	<li>Contributing programmers don&#8217;t need to be able to program an OS, this is an application written in (comparatively) high-level C.</li>
        	<li>Large chunks of contributions do not require programming at all, it is often theme and config file tweaking.</li>
        	<li>Small enough in scope to not take person-decades of effort.</li>
        	<li>Does not require anyone to pay for tools to contribute.</li>
        	<li>Not asking for 2.5 million.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cons</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>It&#8217;ll never be able to exactly make all Linux apps look and behave like <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS ones, you can theme, tweak widget libraries, but it will never be 100% perfect.</li>
        	<li>It&#8217;s far too easy to look at the project and go &#8220;but that&#8217;s not <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS&#8221; and ignore it completely.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Is it finished? Nope, but if this is something you actually want to move forward with you should certainly give it a go and see if it&#8217;s the start you wanted.</p>
        <p>Realistically I do not worry about the &#8216;future of <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS&#8217;, there are not enough people left, and everyone has a different idea of what it is. But if you do worry about such things, I would suggest working out how to contribute to your dreams, as we are way past just sitting on the sidelines and hoping the future falls into your lap.</p>
        <p><sup id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Technically it is not hard-linked to Linux, you could run it on top of one of the BSDs, Solaris, etc, something with XWindows on</p>]]>

        <p>Yes, I did know that Android has avery different interface because it is used on systems quite unlike a standard desktop machine. But the lack of ad init info has been the problem. Taken me ages to get even the basic functions sorted.</p>]]>

        Many moons ago (21 years, actually), I uploaded a bunch of stuff to <a href="http://www.lewisgilbert.co.uk">http://www.lewisgilbert.co.uk</a>. Having left it there, unloved and abandoned for a while, I&#8217;ve now put it on my current site <a href="https://www.inglenot.com/archiology/">Inglenot</a> <br />
        The other site will die soon, so if anyone is still interested or linked to it, please check out the new site.<br />
        Also, if anyone can update the credits &#8211; comp.sys.acorn.networking is still given in the original &#8211; I&#8217;d be grateful<br />

        It was a school coach trip, lot of older kids (although none of them were 18...) and one of them had it on VHS, passed it to the front and said "sir, let's put this on". Teacher promptly fell asleep and we were all terrorised by Freddy Krueger.

        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>-marm is the standard gcc flag for compiling the binary as ARM32 (as opposed to thumb, or whatever the toolchain is set to). The binary can be whatever – what the <span class="caps">JIT</span> generates doesn’t need to match.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It doesn&#8217;t change anything, and this statement is technically true (it would be trivial to support arm32 binary with Thumb2 <span class="caps">JIT</span>, and vice versa, if you had both JITs available), but it turns out WebKit didn&#8217;t have shims between Thumb and traditional so the -marm or -mthumb2 flag would have actually toggled both the binary and the <span class="caps">JIT</span> (pre-2018). I think that explains the confusion about using -marm to use the ARM32 <span class="caps">JIT</span>.</p>
        <p>That&#8217;s possibly the reason the preferred <span class="caps">JIT</span> is Thumb (as the binary would have been Thumb), though another could be because condition flags seem barely used in the generated code, meaning it&#8217;s a waste of memory (space and bandwidth) (4 bits per 32-bit instruction wasted, so may as well use 16bit thumb). I imagine they&#8217;re barely used because it&#8217;s a very simple optimiser which works on all supported CPUs (at the time: SH4/<span class="caps">MIPS</span>/ARM32/AArch64/x86).</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Yes. Feel free to try it &#8211; it&#8217;s in the riscos64-status repository.</p>
        <p>The CI hasn&#8217;t built it properly since I started introducing the tests, but I try to put a version in that repository after it has been updated. <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/tree/master/rm32">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/tree/master/r…</a> has the 32bit <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS version.</p>
        <p>The 64bit version also works too &#8211; you can load that into the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 shell and see it working&#8230;</p>
        <p>Go to: <a href="https://shell.riscos.online/static/term64.html">https://shell.riscos.online/static/term64.html</a></p>
        <p>Then:</p>
        <pre>
        *URLCopy <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/raw/refs/heads/master/rm64/Debugger,ffa">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/raw/refs/head…</a> Debugger
        *SetType Debugger Module
        *RMLoad Debugger
        </pre>
        <p>and you can use it as you might expect &#8211; as stated breakpoint handling is not defined yet for 64bit.</p>
        <p>The demonstration in RPCEmu in episode 11 starts at 2:39:54 so you can see the module being used inside !Zap.</p>
        <p>Around here is where I&#8217;m loading up RPCEmu to test the module:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/sb2PBL2QmVA?si=_ezJA1CaClZjbPgW&amp;t=9594">https://www.youtube.com/live/sb2PBL2QmVA?si=_ezJA1CaCl…</a></p>
        <p>The module is tested on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac, and I&#8217;ve demonstrated it on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 4. I assume it works on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 5 &#8211; other than the breakpoint handling it&#8217;s not doing anything special, and nobody&#8217;s reported any issues. Then again, nobody&#8217;s actually said they tried it so&#8230; meh&#8230;</p>]]>

      <title>Impact of storage speed on RISC OS?</title>

        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>I have a Raspberry Pi 4 and I build a game I wrote, about 40,000 lines of C.<br />
        Building from the SD card takes over 10 minutes, without timing it, building from <span class="caps">RAM</span> disk takes maybe a minute.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Something there doesn&#8217;t quite sound right to me.</p>
        <p>Taking <a href="https://gitlab.riscosopen.org/RiscOS/Sources/HWSupport/USB/Controllers/DWCDriver">DWCDriver</a> as an example of a thing which is ~36000 lines of C, I compiled that on a Pi 2 which has a no-name micro SD card from the supermarket and on 3 runs I get</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>24s</li>
        	<li>24s</li>
        	<li>25s</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those 36000 lines result in 19 object files being written to the card, and looking at the dependencies which are written to the Makefile there are 591 lines, which I interpret as meaning 591 files were <strong>read</strong> in order to <strong>write</strong> 19 object files.</p>
        <p>If anything the times would reduce (if bound by processing speed alone, using the same SD card) as a Pi 4 is faster than a Pi 2, so I wonder how the 40000 lines of the game can take 20x longer to build?</p>]]>

      <title>intro to RISCOS Development</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/9/topics/1092</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>thanks for the list of resources and creating a lot of those by yourself as well – this is impressive.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>My pleasure and I am sure also the guys who helped and <span class="caps">ROOL</span> will be happy to hear all the resources were useful :)</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>there are some toolchains allowing for a great cross-debugging experience (also on-target, I used them for Cortex-M variants) that would streamline the process of doing that adaption moonshot needs.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Indeed. I am rewriting my own <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS using Rust and I have already reached the stage where I can have live source debugging of the entire kernel and even in tools like VSCode, so in my case (and I am talking about my case only) I don&#8217;t have any limitation coming from <span class="caps">DDE</span> being old limited. But <span class="caps">ROOL</span> is a different beast and I am not associated with them in any form or shape, so no idea what they are planning and how. But I know at least a few of them work in embedded development, so I know they are aware of the modern tools available.</p>
        <p>Here is a picture for you:<br />
        <img src="https://paolozaino.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-3.png" width="480" /></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>as far as I know, the <span class="caps">SWI</span> interfacing into module code by using some of the <span class="caps">ARM</span> registers and bank-switching others should translate into a function call in C like it did back in the days with 24bit code, but I assume subtle differences might need addressing (and to overcome) depending on the <span class="caps">ARM</span> core used and depending on the linker.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It&#8217;s already possible to write modules in C and by long time, moreover with the transition to AArch64, they will probably need to embrace an interface like CallASWI which somewhat resemble the mechanism in modern OS used to call proper SysCalls; so I think <span class="caps">ROOL</span> have already addressed this. Given CallASWI is also a mechanism recommended to use on 32bit, it maybe a functional way to make both <span class="caps">ABI</span> and <span class="caps">API</span> feels close and somewhat standardised. But again, I am guessing here, <span class="caps">ROOL</span> is the entity with the details.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>would a simulation of a minimal machine as a ‘proof of concept’ and/or starting point would make sense before switching to real hardware, or does this exist already either intendedly or as an existing product like in the riscos on linux approach?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Not sure what you mean here, sorry. As for my work I debug my own <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS (Merlin) using <span class="caps">QEMU</span> (as well as real Raspberry Pis), so I use <span class="caps">QEMU</span> as the simulation for both 32 and 64 bit . It&#8217;s not perfect, but it does a relatively good job.</p>
        <p>If I was in charge (and I am not), I&#8217;d recommend to use <span class="caps">GCC</span> and make sure to produce a symbol file so that future <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS can be debugged live and source level using <span class="caps">QEMU</span> and the embedded <span class="caps">GDB</span> server, makes everyone&#8217;s life easier (a looooot easier), and allow also less skilled developers to be able to help.</p>
        <p>But people are entitled to their own opinions, so I guess <span class="caps">ROOL</span> at some point will start answering these questions, they are probably catching up with the technical requirements people are posting about here and there.</p>
        <p>Anyway if you&#8217;d like to start a specific topic about the 64bit work please feel free to use the dedicated section of the forum:</p>

      <title>Using OS_UpCall to notify deletion of a file</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/11/topics/20004</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<blockquote><blockquote>They said this in the first paragraph:</blockquote>
        <p>Sometimes a file in a directory within the image will be deleted because of actions elsewhere in the image</blockquote></p>
        <p>Ah, I didn&#8217;t interpret that in that way, then I read the example which I took to mean <code>Image.A.1</code> was being deleted using the Filer yet somehow the UpCall for <code>Image.A.1</code> wasn&#8217;t happening.</p>
        <p>Sounds like the image filing system has a &#8220;real&#8221; file <code>Image.A.1</code> then a virtual/symlink type of setup where you want &#8220;fake&#8221; file <code>Image.Mirage.NotReal.A.1</code> to also vanish from the Filer view. All makes sense now!</p>]]>

      <title>Time for a Qemu port</title>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The whole porting of RiscOS was started by Jeffrey Lee back in the day when the first BeagleBoard came to life and the raspberry pi did not yet exist. <br />
        I responded to a post from Jeffrey when he got stuck with Qemu and needed real hardware that was difficult to come by at the time. <br />
        As I had the same idea some weeks earlier, I already had a BeagleBoard available and so Jeffrey, being as fast as he was, flooded me with new progress often daily so that I had enough to do with getting the stuff onto the board and reporting on what worked and what didn&#8217;t. (Initially I wanted to code as well, but did not want to slow down Jeffrey progress so kept to the role of tester).<br />
        So there was some Qemu code written by Jeffrey, but the code never reached the command line prompt afaik.</p>]]>

      <title>HAL UART Pinebook Pro ( HAL_UARTFeatures )</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/3/topics/20007</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Hi I&#8217;m in the process of writing code for the serial ports on the Pinebook Pro. Am I correct in stating that HAL_UARTFeatures should return the capabilities of the specific port and not the current confugured capabilities ? . For example a port can provide hardware <span class="caps">RTS</span>/<span class="caps">CTS</span> control so bit 3 should be set irrespectively of how it is configured.</p>]]>

      <title>Live Coding with Gerph, Sunday 31st August at 1pm</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/19999</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Live coding today was quite successful, albeit I spent a lot of time fumbling around tweaking bits to <code>*Memory</code> working right &#8211; which, if I&#8217;d thought a bit more, would have been easier.</p>
        <p>Anyhow, comparing against the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac test results, there were a number of changes to tidy the output up and make it more consistent. The results are pretty good. Of the tests we now have a bunch of passes&#8230;</p>
        <pre>
        -----------
        Pass:      20
        Fail:      15
        Crash:      0
        Skip:      36
        -----------
        Total run:       35
        Pass ratio:   57.14 %
        Fail ratio:   42.86 %
        </pre>
        <p>Which means that we&#8217;re quite consistent. These aren&#8217;t automated into the CI yet, so next week, hopefully we can fix a number of them and then automate them to CI.</p>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Hiya,</p>
        <p>Quick update on the progress with OSLib&#8230; I&#8217;ve mentioned before the work that I&#8217;ve done towards creating the OSLib veneers for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 (and using them for other purposes). These are now complete, I believe &#8211; all the interfaces for OSLib should now be converted properly.</p>
        <p>Previously, I&#8217;d not implemented the non- X-variants of the SWIs, and those calls that spilled arguments on to the caller stack were not generated properly. These issues have both now been fixed &#8211; I realised what the &#8216;!&#8217; means on the def file exit parameters, and these are now set up properly. Together with remembering that I&#8217;m working with more registers, the library is now more efficient than previously. Not that that matters really for these calls, but it&#8217;s nice not to use as much stack.</p>

        <p>All of which is to say&#8230; yay! I think I have finally got to the bottom of how the OSLib interface definitions work, and the parser is mostly able to handle them (still doesn&#8217;t handle the comments so well&#8230; but there&#8217;s always scope for improvement), and hopefully OSLib will be useable in some real things soon. I built DrawFile with it a little while back, but it crashed badly, so maybe this&#8217;ll help.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s only taken me another 10 minutes or so to get the testing code working. It&#8217;s shown up loads of little differences that are really quite interesting to see. And probably really easy to fix.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Many of the *Memory tests show up differences in the case of the hex values that it is decoding (eg we use lower case &#8216;a0&#8217; rather than &#8216;A0&#8217;). Easy to fix.</li>
        	<li>The textual representation avoids using top-bit-set characters, displaying them as &#8216;.&#8217; instead of the character. That&#8217;s not a huge problem, and is an easy fix as well.</li>
        	<li>The *MemoryI outputs the hex representation and the textual representation in the opposite order to my other Debugger, which makes everything different.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So at the end of the run we have&#8230;</p>
        <pre>
        Pass:       0
        Fail:      29
        Crash:      0
        Skip:      23
        </pre>
        <p>which isn&#8217;t ideal but almost all of those differences are resolvable.<br />
        I&#8217;ll not commit the code, but leave it until next week and we can investigate the test results and fix what&#8217;s needed.</p>]]>

With no specific topic planned, discussions are steered by what people bring up, so that could be their current works-in-progress, development of RISC OS itself, the tools available, and so on –&#8230;]]>

      <source:markdown>The period between stable releases is the perfect time to try out some experimental changes to RISC OS. If you’ve bought one of the top-of-the-range [Raspberry Pi 4’s](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with 4GB or 8GB of RAM the good news is that that extra memory can now be unlocked by dropping the [Beta RPi ROM (8GB Support)](/zipfiles/platform/raspberry-pi/BCM2835Dev-8GB.5.31.zip) onto your SD card.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Kevin Wells has found another remote application programmer interface (API) to make use of for the benefit of RISC OS users, and as a result has released a new application: Web2PDF. Like a lot of Kevin&#8217;s software, Web2PDF makes use of Wget to relay information input into the program&#8217;s RISC OS window to the remote API, and then feed the results back to the user. Usually those results are presented to the user via the application itself, but this time there is a subtle difference. The remote API used by&#8230;]]>

        <![CDATA[Some time back, Karl Clark released ArcMouse, an interface that could be plugged in to the mouse port on Archimedes-era ARM-based computers from Acorn and allowed a more standard USB mouse to be used. Karl has now improved on the design, and has launched ArcMouse version 2. The new design is that at just 12mm wide, it&#8217;s notably smaller than the older version, which makes it more compatible with the &#8216;all in one&#8217; style of RISC OS computer from Acorn (such as the A3000, on which the mouse port is&#8230;]]>
