      <title>URI Launch Sometimes Fails</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/4/topics/20056</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not sure if this is a bug, and if it is, whose it is&#8230;</p>
        <p>If a <span class="caps">URI</span> is launched through the <span class="caps">URI</span> module (either from another application, or by double-clicking a <span class="caps">URI</span> file), and NetSurf is running, then NetSurf responds to <strong>Message_URI_MProcess</strong> and the page opens in the browser as expected.</p>
        <p>If NetSurf isn&#8217;t running, however, then things don&#8217;t seem to work as expected. <strong>Message_URI_MProcess</strong> goes unanswered<sup id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, so the appropriate <code>Alias$Open_URI_</code> variable is used to load NetSurf (as it&#8217;s the browser claiming that on my system) and then <span class="caps">URI</span> tries again to send <strong>Message_URI_MProcess</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is where things appear to break, because no browser window opens. Checking the messages, it appears that the second broadcast of <strong>Message_URI_MProcess</strong> also goes unacknowledged, and perhaps crucially, NetSurf doesn&#8217;t show up in the list of tasks which are sent the re-broadcast message.</p>
        <p>As I said, I&#8217;m unclear if there&#8217;s a fault here, and where it lies&#8230; So, can anyone else reproduce it?</p>
        <p>Looking at how NetSurf starts up, I notice that two Wimp tasks are launched: &#8220;NetSurfKick&#8221; followed by &#8220;NetSurf&#8221; itself. Could the <span class="caps">URI</span> module be looking for a task to start up as a result of it launching the claimant of <code>Alias$Open_URI_</code>, and so do the re-broadcast when NetSurfKick has started up &#8211; failing to wait for NetSurf itself to get going? That&#8217;s complete speculation: I&#8217;ve not dug into this any further than described above.</p>
        <p id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Interestingly, this appears to prompt <span class="caps">URI</span> to try the <span class="caps">ANT</span> <strong>Message_OpenURL</strong> as a fallback. I hadn&#8217;t realised that it did this!</p>]]>

      <source:markdown>I’m not sure if this is a bug, and if it is, whose it is…

If a URI is launched through the URI module (either from another application, or by double-clicking a URI file), and NetSurf is running, then NetSurf responds to **Message\_URI\_MProcess** and the page opens in the browser as expected.

If NetSurf isn’t running, however, then things don’t seem to work as expected. **Message\_URI\_MProcess** goes unanswered[1](#fn1), so the appropriate `Alias$Open_URI_` variable is used to load NetSurf (as it’s the browser claiming that on my system) and then URI tries again to send **Message\_URI\_MProcess**.

This is where things appear to break, because no browser window opens. Checking the messages, it appears that the second broadcast of **Message\_URI\_MProcess** also goes unacknowledged, and perhaps crucially, NetSurf doesn’t show up in the list of tasks which are sent the re-broadcast message.

As I said, I’m unclear if there’s a fault here, and where it lies… So, can anyone else reproduce it?

Looking at how NetSurf starts up, I notice that two Wimp tasks are launched: “NetSurfKick” followed by “NetSurf” itself. Could the URI module be looking for a task to start up as a result of it launching the claimant of `Alias$Open_URI_`, and so do the re-broadcast when NetSurfKick has started up – failing to wait for NetSurf itself to get going? That’s complete speculation: I’ve not dug into this any further than described above.

[1](#fnr1) Interestingly, this appears to prompt URI to try the ANT **Message\_OpenURL** as a fallback. I hadn’t realised that it did this!</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>Hiya,

This Sunday – 19th October, at 1pm – I’m doing the live coding again, continuing with the SystemVars module.

Come along if you like – [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzZpQit8eVc?feature=sh…](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzZpQit8eVc?feature=share)

– or you can always watch the video afterwards at the same address.

This week, I’ll be looking at adding the code variables and hooking into the \`OS\_\*\` SWIs.

* * *

For anyone who hasn’t seen these live coding sessions, this where I share my screen for about 3 hours and code some RISC OS component, whilst talking about what I’m doing, what I’m thinking, and answering questions on the chat.

So far, the implementation has:

- SWI implementations in the module (as regular SWIs)
- Reading string, macro, and number variables through a SWI.
- Writing string, number, GSTrans and evaluated variables through a SWI.
- Enumeration and deletion of variables.
- Tests of the read/write process, both in the interface and the SWIs.
- Automatic builds and releases through the CI on GitHub.
- The module can be built and runs on 32-bit and 64-bit RISC OS.

        <![CDATA[<p>What time did you get such a fast download?!</p>
        <p>The &#8216;Luminist&#8217; ssite is slow <span class="caps">IIUC</span> because it&#8217;s content is in high demand. In particular I&#8217;ve noticed it is <strong>much</strong> slower when people in the <span class="caps">USA</span> are up and about than earlier in (our UK) day and they&#8217;re mostly asleep! Indeed, I&#8217;ve had messages that it wasn&#8217;t available at those times, so fetching early in the UK tends to be faster.</p>
        <p>!Iris now works OK for the Luminist-hosted and google-hosted items. However so does !NetSurf which is about as fast. Similar for wget for the Luminist files. But the updated !Iris items still fails to fetch the &#8216;adobe&#8217; hosted files which is the main <span class="caps">PITA</span> from my <span class="caps">POV</span>. The real prize there for me is the &#8216;Far Frontiers&#8217; issues which I <strong>really</strong> want to get as material edited by Jim Baen is wthe most interesting for me, and the highest quality <span class="caps">IMHO</span>. I can get the other mags and book he edited. But not those.  Very frustrating.</p>
        <p>I&#8217;d feed this back to the !Iris developer, but don&#8217;t know how to contact them&#8230; and they may not want to be pestered with this anyway!</p>
        <p>Do you mean I can click &#8216;&#8230;&#8217; as soon as a fetch starts and it then bypasses waiting to render? Or am I nut understanding?</p>
        <p>wget and !NetSurf have the advantage that I can watch the file content accumulate and let it chug though a set as I do summat else.

      <source:markdown>What time did you get such a fast download?!

The ‘Luminist’ ssite is slow IIUC because it’s content is in high demand. In particular I’ve noticed it is **much** slower when people in the USA are up and about than earlier in (our UK) day and they’re mostly asleep! Indeed, I’ve had messages that it wasn’t available at those times, so fetching early in the UK tends to be faster.

!Iris now works OK for the Luminist-hosted and google-hosted items. However so does !NetSurf which is about as fast. Similar for wget for the Luminist files. But the updated !Iris items still fails to fetch the ‘adobe’ hosted files which is the main PITA from my POV. The real prize there for me is the ‘Far Frontiers’ issues which I **really** want to get as material edited by Jim Baen is wthe most interesting for me, and the highest quality IMHO. I can get the other mags and book he edited. But not those. Very frustrating.

I’d feed this back to the !Iris developer, but don’t know how to contact them… and they may not want to be pestered with this anyway!

Do you mean I can click ‘…’ as soon as a fetch starts and it then bypasses waiting to render? Or am I nut understanding?

wget and !NetSurf have the advantage that I can watch the file content accumulate and let it chug though a set as I do summat else. But can’t find a way to get wget to fetch the non-luminist items. Otherwise I’d use it for the ‘adobe’ addressed ones which are my main lack at present.

Joy to be able to fill in gaps and read various serials where – in terms of paper mags – I don;t have key issues.

Moving on a ‘RO tangent’: given that !MuView renders ebooks **inc** non-pdf ones I can’t help thinking it might make a basis for an ebook reader for RO. One that could then also allow open adding of features to help make ‘poor scans’ more reabable by having tweaks like being able to minimise the effect of poor scans or yellowed paper. If that existed I’d get a RO portable machine instead of the android tablet! 8-\]</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>It’s okay. We’re not launching a RISCOSbits Whisky at the show, it’s just your chance to reserve items from our Show Stock.

Due to an impromptu, badly timed and slightly inconvenient holiday, immediately before the show, we’re out of time to take orders to build up pre-ordered machines to be collected on the day.

So to make amends, we’re offering a chance to reserve items for purchase on the day. We’ll have the following items on sale:

**VENOM** – premium compact NVMe machine

**FAST NVMe** – another excellent premium NVMe machine in a full Mini ITX case

**DIY Systems** – we have the ONE, TWO, and THREE systems available to reserve

**Chimera** – a multi-headed machine with a special free surprise for the show!

**PiRO Qube** – the smallest NVMe machine possible!

**eNVy.Me** – a modern, lightning blue NVMe system with a unique case

**FASTFIRE** – our speedy SATA machine with multi-disc capabilities. The fastest true multi-disc systems available.

We’ll also have a few late additions to our usual range with bumped up specs. Plus a range of very new things that should signal it’s worth making the case for visiting us at the show. But we’re not putting those up for reserve. You’ll have to coast on over for those.

To reserve your item, drop us an email at [london2025@riscosbits.co.uk](mailto:london2025@riscosbits.co.uk) to let us know what you’d like us to hold for you.

Reservations will be made on a first come, first served basis. All we ask is that you collect your reserved items by 1pm on the day so we don’t have to disappoint too many people!</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>There is a thread over on stardot regarding getting an ADF10 Econet module to work on a UNIPOD, it presents anecdotal evidence that this been done successfully before but evidently lost without trace.

[https://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=29655](https://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=29655)

I have long wondered about that and in a moment of weakness decided to have a look at it.

SO far I have taken the Econet module source from the IOMD build of RISC OS 5 from my RasPi over to a SA RPC with a unipod, and up to date ROOLDDE, where I can build it out of the RISC OS source tree by dropping its make file into amu.

This results in several targets RMs including Econet, EconetSA &#38; EconetD. The EconetSA module works on anther SA RPC with an Acorn AEH60 Econet module, so that’s a good start at any rate.

In the source I can see quite a lot of extra debugging output, particularly around scanning the podules for the right one, an area that I need to rework first. But running EconetD does not result in any debugging output, and nor actually are any of the strings I can see in this code present in the binary.

I have not used objasm before and never explored this mire of macros.

I can see in code section below what appears to be conditional assembly dependent on ‘DebugFindHardware’

FindPoduleLoop

DECS r3

BMI AddressUnknown

\[ DebugFindHardware

BREG r3, “Podule\_ReadInfo: R3 = &#38;”

\]

Push “r10, r11, r14”

MOV r0, #Podule\_ReadInfo\_SyncBase + Podule\_ReadInfo\_ID + Podule\_ReadInfo\_Type

MOV r1, sp

MOV r2, #3\*4

SWI XPodule\_ReadInfo

Pull “r10, r11, r14”

\[ DebugFindHardware

DREG r10, “Synchronous base address = &#38;”

BREG r11, “ID = &#38;”

DREG r14, “Type = &#38;”

\]

BVS FindPoduleLoop

BIC r11, r11, #2\_101 ; Knock out FIQ/IRQ request bits

TEQ r11, #SimpleType\_Econet:SHL:3

BEQ AddressKnown

TEQ r11, #SimpleType\_Extended:SHL:3

TEQEQ r14, #ProdType\_Econet

BEQ AddressKnown

B FindPoduleLoop

AddressUnknown

LDR r10, =EconetController ; Default for internal hardware

AddressKnown

\[ DebugFindHardware

DREG r10, “Address we are using = &#38;”

\]

I can see that ‘DebugFindHardware’ appears to be set in this line but I am not making any sense of it:

DebugFindHardware SETL (:LNOT: ReleaseVersion) :LAND: {FALSE}

The make file does not seem to hint at how debug options are set either.

What am I missing here?

      <source:markdown>Thanks to David Feugey for allowing me to use a sub-domain on his ‘riscos.fr’ website, I am releasing a 32-bit Risc OS 5 version of !ARM\_Debug. Anybody interested can now have a ‘play’.

This is 32-bit version of Theo Van Der Boogaert’s original RO4 standalone debugger and works independently of the DDE (or whatever). It does require RISC OS 5 to run though:

[https://www.fladda.riscos.fr/](https://www.fladda.riscos.fr/)

This is a first ‘beta’ release and contains some known bugs and no doubt some unknown bugs. All comments welcome.

I next plan to look at implementing SPSR (SVC and USR) support and possibly some co-processor instruction support (these instructions appear to be used in the RO5 kernel).

      <source:markdown>I’m pleased to announce the release of Today version 3.20. The application lists events that have taken place (or will take place) on a given date. It contains a database of historical information, to which additional dates and personal anniversaries can be added.

![](https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/data/software/today/screen1.jpg)

Originally written by James Miskin, I produced a 32-bit update in 2006. Almost 20 years later, following a question at RISC OS North back in March, I went on a hunt for the source code, dusted it off, and have produced a new version with the following changes:

- The application has been built with a toolchain known to be ARMv7 compatible.
- There is now a Help… entry in the main and iconbar menus.
- The date shown in the scan window is updated when the system clock changes day, so long as the window was previously on the current day.
- The upper bound for the day of the month is correctly set when opening the event window.
- A minimum window size is applied when setting the extent of the scan and search windows, to avoid the search results being hidden.

A copy of version 3.20 can be found on my website, at [https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/today](https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/today). It has also been added — finally — to the PlingStore, and if I’ve managed to find the correct incantations it should also show up in PackMan over the next few days.

Originally released into the Public Domain by James, I have applied version 1.2 of the EUPL to the new release to make its status clear, and the source code can finally be found amongst my other projects on GitHub at [https://github.com/steve-fryatt/today](https://github.com/steve-fryatt/today)</source:markdown>

        <ul>
        	<li>Support for loading and saving Puzzle files, allowing a game to be saved at any point with its complete history. These are cross-platform compatible with any other front-end that can save and load files.</li>
        	<li>Support for copying many of the games to the clipboard in a textual format.</li>
        	<li>Support for saving game preferences to disc as defaults for future sessions.</li>

      <source:markdown>It wouldn’t be the run-up to a show without my doing some last-minute software development… so there’s yet another new test release of Puzzles (524c5af) up at [https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/games](https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/risc-os/games)

![](https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/scrap/puzzles-save.png)

This is finally getting close to what might become a “stable” release, and contains the following changes from the last one:

- Support for loading and saving Puzzle files, allowing a game to be saved at any point with its complete history. These are cross-platform compatible with any other front-end that can save and load files.
- Support for copying many of the games to the clipboard in a textual format.
- Support for saving game preferences to disc as defaults for future sessions.
- Support for saving the contents of the game window out as a sprite.
- The addition of intermediate colours to the game window colour palette, which facilitates better font anti-aliasing (and also anti-aliasing of some of the line graphics if SpecialFX is loaded).
- An update to upstream e00cb46, from just under a fortnight ago.

I _think_ this gets us close to feature-parity with some of the other front-ends, in particular the GTK one for Linux.

As ever, you’re all the testers – so if no-one downloads a copy and tries it, I won’t know what I haven’t written correctly!</source:markdown>

      <source:markdown>&#62; if your audience would find it easier to do something another way, and you actively choose to do something different… then you are failing your audience.

If we take that statement literally then almost everything in RISC OS, old and new, could be seen as “failing” the audience. For example, people have been asking for easier development environments or multi-core support for years, and those needs are still unmet (and after sponsoring 2.5M GBP they still will be unmet apparently!).

That said, I do think Steve has a point.

If someone wanted to organise an online-only event (say a “RISC OS Xmas online show”), I am sure plenty of us could contribute material. The format would mostly be one-way, with prepared videos or live presentations and only limited feedback.

In-person shows, in contrast, work very differently. From my own experience, I get much more direct feedback and can respond to exactly what people are interested in. It also allows for spontaneous conversations that just do not happen online. On Zoom, only one person can really speak at a time, and asking questions in front of a whole audience may not suit everyone.

For example, at the last Bristol show I attended, I was constantly busy with people asking questions, and once the initial “ice” was broken, I had some really valuable and enjoyable conversations. That kind of interaction is very hard to replicate online.

So to me, the two experiences serve different purposes. Online events are valuable, but they cannot replace in-person shows. Even for those of us doing free software rather than running businesses, I think the in-person format offers something unique.

Hence I don’t think the in-person shows are “failing their audience”, I think they are fine and having only two in-person shows per year seems to be a good number given the slow pass in developments that are happening on RISC OS (it’s an old platform and it takes time to build stuff on it). There might be space for an on-line event for who cannot attend the in-person event.

For what concern discussing users issues, I think user-group meetings are still way more valuable (either in person or on-line), given the focus of such meetings.</source:markdown>

        <![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s live coding was very successful.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>GSTrans of variables on set now works, meaning that there&#8217;s a distinction between type 0 and type 4 variables.</li>
        	<li>EvaluateExpression variables (type 3) are now handled on set.</li>
        	<li>Number type variables (type 1) are handled on set.</li>
        	<li>A new *-command has been added to allow easier debugging of the variables that have been set.</li>
        	<li>Simple tests added to check the type, length and returned values from the SWIs have been added. These are run during the CI.</li>
        	<li>Fortify is now present in the build, checking that the memory has all been freed (and the memory leaks have been fixed).</li>
        	<li>Release 0.02 has been made and, as usual, the binaries are also in the riscos64-status repository.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Missing bits&#8230;</p>
        <ul>

        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>I can understand the attraction of using pCloud directly from <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. But failing that, if you have a <span class="caps">NAS</span>, it may be poossible to get the <span class="caps">NAS</span> to connect to pCloud, and then use LanMan98 or <span class="caps">NFS</span> to access it from <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS until CloudFS is revived.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I actually use this approach anyway now. The reality is this approach also boost performance. I let my Linux box do the sync up in the background, while local share is ultra fast like this and has another advantage, as soon as my ShareFS for Linux is completed and working, I&#8217;ll &#8220;re-share&#8221; my pCloud via ShareFS Server, which means pCLoud for old <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 3 on the Archie as well! ;)</p>
        <p>So the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS pCloud client is useful only to who has not a 3rd party Linux box in their network.</p>
        <p>Just my 0.5c.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I’ve taken a couple of embedded projects from ARM32 to AArch64. The biggest time sinks weren’t the compiler, but hidden 32-bit assumptions: pointer math in ints, varargs, packed structs, and unions. Rewriting inline asm and aligning to the AAPCS64 calling convention was unavoidable. What helped most was harsh warnings, UBSan/ASan in tests, and swapping types to size_t/uintptr_t early. For legacy apps we used a small thunk layer and kept a 32-bit build running until parity.</p>]]>

      <title>Live Coding with Gerph, Sunday 21st September at 1pm.</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/20026</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Live coding today was another success&#8230;</p>
        <p>There&#8217;s now a Git repository on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-systemvars">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-systemvars</a>) stub module for SystemVars, which allows simple strings to be stored in a dictionary and retrieved. There are some simple SWIs implemented that allow the interface to be exercised. The module also has CI to ensure that the build and loading of the module is successful &#8211; and there&#8217;s a small test to exercise the internals.</p>
        <p>As usual, if anyone has any questions, comments or even code suggestions and PRs, please fire them this way.</p>]]>

      <title>RISC OS 64bit work status</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/13/topics/20027</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Quick status update on the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 progress, since I posted last&#8230;</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The links on the repository have been updated with pages for individual modules, listing the features that those modules need to have and their current status.</li>
        	<li>I&#8217;m happy with my implementation of the Debugger module now, and the live coding for that has finished. It&#8217;s not quite as functional as the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac version / the riscos-disassemble Python package, but it&#8217;s working ok for me.</li>
        	<li>New `Conversions` module implementation which works.</li>
        	<li>Most of the `Convert*` modules have now been built, though not tested in 64bit (they&#8217;re not really important at this stage, but it&#8217;s good to know they build!</li>
        	<li>The `IconBorders` modules all build just fine.</li>
        	<li>Problems I had with `RemotePrinterSupport` have now been fixed and it builds in 64bit.</li>
        	<li>`ResourceFS` stub module is now complete, and obviously doesn&#8217;t do much yet.</li>
        	<li>`VideoTTX`, `VideoGuard` and `MimeMap` built for 64bit, although they&#8217;re not tested and probably won&#8217;t quite do what&#8217;s expected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And internally I&#8217;ve been updating my build environment to better handle certain cases that weren&#8217;t working previously.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Build service now has the ability to enable faster builds, using the host version of the tools &#8211; see <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/741270">https://asciinema.org/a/741270</a> for a simple run.</li>
        	<li>Improved integration within the SublimeText editor &#8211; pressing command-B can now build things with <span class="caps">AMU</span> locally and highlight the errors inline in the file, or with the build service.</li>
        	<li>Improvements to CMunge for 64bit interfaces that weren&#8217;t quite right, and the -zerrors switch, that I had recently broken.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The most recent test run says that most of the modules and tools that are present in the repository at least load correctly:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/actions/runs/17814204760">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/actions/runs/…</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The progress for Phase 1 is looking pretty good now, with many components exceeding the original aims for this phase. Still 17 falling short, but they&#8217;re probably going to be reletively easy to get to an appropriate state.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Progress">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Progress</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>And the SystemVars module is one of those modules that I will be moving on to in the Live Coding sessions. I suspect this will be relatively easy to deal with, but there will almost certainly be some special cases to handle.</p>
        <p>Anyhow that&#8217;s where things are for me. You can always follow the repositories to see what&#8217;s being done.</p>
        <p>Again, if anyone wants to contribute to these, please speak up.</p>]]>

      <title>Debugger module release</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/20025</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Over the course of the last 19 live coding sessions, I have produced a Debugger module which supports many of the things that we expect on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. We support&#8230;</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><code>*Memory</code></li>
        	<li><code>*MemoryI</code></li>
        	<li><code>*MemoryA</code></li>
        	<li><code>*DumpI</code></li>
        	<li><code>*InitStore</code></li>
        	<li><code>*ShowRegs</code></li>
        	<li><code>*BreakSet</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*BreakClr</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*BreakList</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*Debug</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*Continue</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_Disassemble</code></li>
        	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_DisassembleThumb</code></li>
        	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_DisassembleArch</code> (for AArch32 <span class="caps">ARM</span> and Thumb, and for AArch64 instructions)</li>
        	<li>AArch32 instructions are disassembled (default for regular <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS), including the <span class="caps">FPA</span> instructions.</li>
        	<li>AArch64 instructions are disassembled (default for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li>The module is built and released automatically through CI on GitHub – <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases</a></li>
        	<li>There’s a project board to record what needs to be done – <a href="https://github.com/users/gerph/projects/1">https://github.com/users/gerph/projects/1</a></li>
        	<li>The module can be built, and runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS.</li>
        	<li>The module is tested with test code derived from the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac test suites &#8211; automatically within CI.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The module has been demonstrated and run on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS in RPCEmu with !Zap and works as you might expect.</p>
        <p>The module can be obtained from the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Debugger GitHub site &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases</a></p>
        <hr />
        <p>The purpose of the Live Coding sessions was &#8211; initially &#8211; so that I could get some practice at doing coding in a different environment, and demonstrating how some techniques and skills can be used. I was hoping that it would be an encouragement to others that things which seem complicated are largely just a set of small steps to address a problem.</p>
        <p>The Debugger module was intended to be a &#8216;simple&#8217; example of how porting something useful to <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS can be done. It wasn&#8217;t quite so simple &#8211; there&#8217;s been work in shell, in python, in perl, and assembler and converting from C99 to C89. And working with someone else&#8217;s code which I didn&#8217;t understand at first. I hope that it has given people some encouragement to try doing things they wouldn&#8217;t have. I hope that it has also shown that mistakes are many and plentiful &#8211; and we roll with them. It&#8217;s also shown how bad my typing is!</p>
        <p>It&#8217;s been very exciting. I&#8217;ve laughed a lot. And along the way there&#8217;s been a number of people coming into the chat and watching the sessions without knowing anything about <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. People who asked questions &#8211; even if they&#8217;re not on the topic of the debugger &#8211; and have been very friendly. That&#8217;s been a nice experience too.</p>
        <p>So it&#8217;s been quite successful, and has produced a replacement module in C for an existing module. Feel free to raise bugs in GitHub, and PRs will be happily received if they&#8217;re incremental and reviewable.</p>]]>

      <title>Live Coding with Gerph, Sunday 14th September at 1pm</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/20019</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This was the final session on the Debugger. I&#8217;m pretty happy with the disassembler now. This final session updated the CI tests so that they (mostly) pass. There were some failures when it was finally integrated into the CI, which I decided to fix offline &#8211; they were caused by the use of a non-deterministic part of the table generation in Python. Now that it&#8217;s fixed, I think we&#8217;ve got a good version.</p>
        <p>The Debugger has been published up on the site in the releases section: <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c</a></p>
        <p>The 64bit version can be found on the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64bit status pages: <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status</a></p>
        <hr />
        <p>Next week, I&#8217;ll be starting on a different project &#8211; something short, I hope!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I suppose I should reply to this thread</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>My view is that if there is any wider future for “RISC OS”, it’s applying the look and feel to the 64 bit OS and applications that I and millions of others are using on Linux.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A lot of what you desire already exists, or at least a runnable foundation does.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHsHU-dDwAk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHsHU-dDwAk</a></p>
        <p>Source code here;<br />
        <a href="https://home.marutan.net/hg/riscwm">https://home.marutan.net/hg/riscwm</a></p>
        <p>Here are a few pros and cons compared;</p>
        <p>Pros</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Already runs on 64bit (arm, x64, powerpc, whatever)</li>
        	<li>Runs Linux <sup id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> apps (technically more easily than <span class="caps">ROLF</span>, as it doesn&#8217;t require apps to be recompiled/linked against a different graphics stack).</li>
        	<li>Runs <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS apps, via RPCEmu</li>
        	<li>Contributing programmers don&#8217;t need to be able to program an OS, this is an application written in (comparatively) high-level C.</li>
        	<li>Large chunks of contributions do not require programming at all, it is often theme and config file tweaking.</li>
        	<li>Small enough in scope to not take person-decades of effort.</li>
        	<li>Does not require anyone to pay for tools to contribute.</li>
        	<li>Not asking for 2.5 million.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cons</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>It&#8217;ll never be able to exactly make all Linux apps look and behave like <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS ones, you can theme, tweak widget libraries, but it will never be 100% perfect.</li>
        	<li>It&#8217;s far too easy to look at the project and go &#8220;but that&#8217;s not <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS&#8221; and ignore it completely.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Is it finished? Nope, but if this is something you actually want to move forward with you should certainly give it a go and see if it&#8217;s the start you wanted.</p>
        <p>Realistically I do not worry about the &#8216;future of <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS&#8217;, there are not enough people left, and everyone has a different idea of what it is. But if you do worry about such things, I would suggest working out how to contribute to your dreams, as we are way past just sitting on the sidelines and hoping the future falls into your lap.</p>
        <p><sup id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Technically it is not hard-linked to Linux, you could run it on top of one of the BSDs, Solaris, etc, something with XWindows on</p>]]>

Even the maker&#8217;s webpages don&#8217;t help much and even use different icons to what I see on a new machine! It&#8217;s assumed the owner &#8216;just knows&#8217;.</p>
        <p>Yes, I did know that Android has avery different interface because it is used on systems quite unlike a standard desktop machine. But the lack of ad init info has been the problem. Taken me ages to get even the basic functions sorted.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hi all<br />
        Many moons ago (21 years, actually), I uploaded a bunch of stuff to <a href="http://www.lewisgilbert.co.uk">http://www.lewisgilbert.co.uk</a>. Having left it there, unloved and abandoned for a while, I&#8217;ve now put it on my current site <a href="https://www.inglenot.com/archiology/">Inglenot</a> <br />
        The other site will die soon, so if anyone is still interested or linked to it, please check out the new site.<br />
        Also, if anyone can update the credits &#8211; comp.sys.acorn.networking is still given in the original &#8211; I&#8217;d be grateful<br />
        Cheers<br />

        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>-marm is the standard gcc flag for compiling the binary as ARM32 (as opposed to thumb, or whatever the toolchain is set to). The binary can be whatever – what the <span class="caps">JIT</span> generates doesn’t need to match.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It doesn&#8217;t change anything, and this statement is technically true (it would be trivial to support arm32 binary with Thumb2 <span class="caps">JIT</span>, and vice versa, if you had both JITs available), but it turns out WebKit didn&#8217;t have shims between Thumb and traditional so the -marm or -mthumb2 flag would have actually toggled both the binary and the <span class="caps">JIT</span> (pre-2018). I think that explains the confusion about using -marm to use the ARM32 <span class="caps">JIT</span>.</p>
        <p>That&#8217;s possibly the reason the preferred <span class="caps">JIT</span> is Thumb (as the binary would have been Thumb), though another could be because condition flags seem barely used in the generated code, meaning it&#8217;s a waste of memory (space and bandwidth) (4 bits per 32-bit instruction wasted, so may as well use 16bit thumb). I imagine they&#8217;re barely used because it&#8217;s a very simple optimiser which works on all supported CPUs (at the time: SH4/<span class="caps">MIPS</span>/ARM32/AArch64/x86).</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Yes. Feel free to try it &#8211; it&#8217;s in the riscos64-status repository.</p>
        <p>The CI hasn&#8217;t built it properly since I started introducing the tests, but I try to put a version in that repository after it has been updated. <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/tree/master/rm32">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/tree/master/r…</a> has the 32bit <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS version.</p>
        <p>The 64bit version also works too &#8211; you can load that into the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 shell and see it working&#8230;</p>
        <p>Go to: <a href="https://shell.riscos.online/static/term64.html">https://shell.riscos.online/static/term64.html</a></p>
        <p>Then:</p>
        <pre>
        *URLCopy <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/raw/refs/heads/master/rm64/Debugger,ffa">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/raw/refs/head…</a> Debugger
        *SetType Debugger Module
        *RMLoad Debugger
        </pre>
        <p>and you can use it as you might expect &#8211; as stated breakpoint handling is not defined yet for 64bit.</p>
        <p>The demonstration in RPCEmu in episode 11 starts at 2:39:54 so you can see the module being used inside !Zap.</p>
        <p>Around here is where I&#8217;m loading up RPCEmu to test the module:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/sb2PBL2QmVA?si=_ezJA1CaClZjbPgW&amp;t=9594">https://www.youtube.com/live/sb2PBL2QmVA?si=_ezJA1CaCl…</a></p>
        <p>The module is tested on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac, and I&#8217;ve demonstrated it on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 4. I assume it works on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 5 &#8211; other than the breakpoint handling it&#8217;s not doing anything special, and nobody&#8217;s reported any issues. Then again, nobody&#8217;s actually said they tried it so&#8230; meh&#8230;</p>]]>

      <title>Impact of storage speed on RISC OS?</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/11/topics/20006</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>I have a Raspberry Pi 4 and I build a game I wrote, about 40,000 lines of C.<br />
        Building from the SD card takes over 10 minutes, without timing it, building from <span class="caps">RAM</span> disk takes maybe a minute.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Something there doesn&#8217;t quite sound right to me.</p>
        <p>Taking <a href="https://gitlab.riscosopen.org/RiscOS/Sources/HWSupport/USB/Controllers/DWCDriver">DWCDriver</a> as an example of a thing which is ~36000 lines of C, I compiled that on a Pi 2 which has a no-name micro SD card from the supermarket and on 3 runs I get</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>24s</li>
        	<li>24s</li>
        	<li>25s</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those 36000 lines result in 19 object files being written to the card, and looking at the dependencies which are written to the Makefile there are 591 lines, which I interpret as meaning 591 files were <strong>read</strong> in order to <strong>write</strong> 19 object files.</p>
        <p>If anything the times would reduce (if bound by processing speed alone, using the same SD card) as a Pi 4 is faster than a Pi 2, so I wonder how the 40000 lines of the game can take 20x longer to build?</p>]]>

      <title>RDPclient with Windows 10</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/11/topics/20005</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>It would be nice to hear from somebody who can say:<br />
        <em>“Yes, I am using !RDPclient on Windows 10 Pro 24H2 and this is what I did.”</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Mine is Windows 10 Pro, Version	22H2 (the latest), OS Build 19045.6216 and I can&#8217;t for the life of me work out why it works for me and not for you. It&#8217;ll be one mystical incantation somewhere that&#8217;s been forgotten by time (or, as Steve suggests, overridden in newer versions and updates). That said, I have it working on Windows 11 &#8211; for now, at least.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The OpenSSL code compiled into RDPClient is dated 2004, recompiling to use the current code is the way to go. Probably utilising the AcornSSL module as a more future-proof system-wide <span class="caps">SSL</span>/<span class="caps">TLS</span> support.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I&#8217;d love to see this happen, but I know where people have tried to build just the existing source, it doesn&#8217;t work well. Andrew Sellors did pop up at one point and in a brief conversation he said he might look at updating to the latest codebase, but I think he&#8217;s long gone from the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS world now.</p>
        <p>For anyone who&#8217;s used RDPClient, going back to <span class="caps">VNC</span> is painfully slow and clunky, and ultimately much poorer experience.</p>]]>

      <title>intro to RISCOS Development</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/9/topics/1092</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>thanks for the list of resources and creating a lot of those by yourself as well – this is impressive.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>My pleasure and I am sure also the guys who helped and <span class="caps">ROOL</span> will be happy to hear all the resources were useful :)</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>there are some toolchains allowing for a great cross-debugging experience (also on-target, I used them for Cortex-M variants) that would streamline the process of doing that adaption moonshot needs.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Indeed. I am rewriting my own <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS using Rust and I have already reached the stage where I can have live source debugging of the entire kernel and even in tools like VSCode, so in my case (and I am talking about my case only) I don&#8217;t have any limitation coming from <span class="caps">DDE</span> being old limited. But <span class="caps">ROOL</span> is a different beast and I am not associated with them in any form or shape, so no idea what they are planning and how. But I know at least a few of them work in embedded development, so I know they are aware of the modern tools available.</p>
        <p>Here is a picture for you:<br />
        <img src="https://paolozaino.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-3.png" width="480" /></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>as far as I know, the <span class="caps">SWI</span> interfacing into module code by using some of the <span class="caps">ARM</span> registers and bank-switching others should translate into a function call in C like it did back in the days with 24bit code, but I assume subtle differences might need addressing (and to overcome) depending on the <span class="caps">ARM</span> core used and depending on the linker.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It&#8217;s already possible to write modules in C and by long time, moreover with the transition to AArch64, they will probably need to embrace an interface like CallASWI which somewhat resemble the mechanism in modern OS used to call proper SysCalls; so I think <span class="caps">ROOL</span> have already addressed this. Given CallASWI is also a mechanism recommended to use on 32bit, it maybe a functional way to make both <span class="caps">ABI</span> and <span class="caps">API</span> feels close and somewhat standardised. But again, I am guessing here, <span class="caps">ROOL</span> is the entity with the details.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>would a simulation of a minimal machine as a ‘proof of concept’ and/or starting point would make sense before switching to real hardware, or does this exist already either intendedly or as an existing product like in the riscos on linux approach?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Not sure what you mean here, sorry. As for my work I debug my own <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS (Merlin) using <span class="caps">QEMU</span> (as well as real Raspberry Pis), so I use <span class="caps">QEMU</span> as the simulation for both 32 and 64 bit . It&#8217;s not perfect, but it does a relatively good job.</p>
        <p>If I was in charge (and I am not), I&#8217;d recommend to use <span class="caps">GCC</span> and make sure to produce a symbol file so that future <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS can be debugged live and source level using <span class="caps">QEMU</span> and the embedded <span class="caps">GDB</span> server, makes everyone&#8217;s life easier (a looooot easier), and allow also less skilled developers to be able to help.</p>
        <p>But people are entitled to their own opinions, so I guess <span class="caps">ROOL</span> at some point will start answering these questions, they are probably catching up with the technical requirements people are posting about here and there.</p>
        <p>Anyway if you&#8217;d like to start a specific topic about the 64bit work please feel free to use the dedicated section of the forum:</p>

      <title>Using OS_UpCall to notify deletion of a file</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/11/topics/20004</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<blockquote><blockquote>They said this in the first paragraph:</blockquote>
        <p>Sometimes a file in a directory within the image will be deleted because of actions elsewhere in the image</blockquote></p>
        <p>Ah, I didn&#8217;t interpret that in that way, then I read the example which I took to mean <code>Image.A.1</code> was being deleted using the Filer yet somehow the UpCall for <code>Image.A.1</code> wasn&#8217;t happening.</p>
        <p>Sounds like the image filing system has a &#8220;real&#8221; file <code>Image.A.1</code> then a virtual/symlink type of setup where you want &#8220;fake&#8221; file <code>Image.Mirage.NotReal.A.1</code> to also vanish from the Filer view. All makes sense now!</p>]]>

      <title>Time for a Qemu port</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/9/topics/18863</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The whole porting of RiscOS was started by Jeffrey Lee back in the day when the first BeagleBoard came to life and the raspberry pi did not yet exist. <br />
        I responded to a post from Jeffrey when he got stuck with Qemu and needed real hardware that was difficult to come by at the time. <br />
        As I had the same idea some weeks earlier, I already had a BeagleBoard available and so Jeffrey, being as fast as he was, flooded me with new progress often daily so that I had enough to do with getting the stuff onto the board and reporting on what worked and what didn&#8217;t. (Initially I wanted to code as well, but did not want to slow down Jeffrey progress so kept to the role of tester).<br />
        So there was some Qemu code written by Jeffrey, but the code never reached the command line prompt afaik.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hi I&#8217;m in the process of writing code for the serial ports on the Pinebook Pro. Am I correct in stating that HAL_UARTFeatures should return the capabilities of the specific port and not the current confugured capabilities ? . For example a port can provide hardware <span class="caps">RTS</span>/<span class="caps">CTS</span> control so bit 3 should be set irrespectively of how it is configured.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Live coding today was quite successful, albeit I spent a lot of time fumbling around tweaking bits to <code>*Memory</code> working right &#8211; which, if I&#8217;d thought a bit more, would have been easier.</p>
        <p>Anyhow, comparing against the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac test results, there were a number of changes to tidy the output up and make it more consistent. The results are pretty good. Of the tests we now have a bunch of passes&#8230;</p>
        <pre>
        -----------
        Pass:      20
        Fail:      15
        Crash:      0
        Skip:      36

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Hiya,</p>
        <p>Quick update on the progress with OSLib&#8230; I&#8217;ve mentioned before the work that I&#8217;ve done towards creating the OSLib veneers for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 (and using them for other purposes). These are now complete, I believe &#8211; all the interfaces for OSLib should now be converted properly.</p>
        <p>Previously, I&#8217;d not implemented the non- X-variants of the SWIs, and those calls that spilled arguments on to the caller stack were not generated properly. These issues have both now been fixed &#8211; I realised what the &#8216;!&#8217; means on the def file exit parameters, and these are now set up properly. Together with remembering that I&#8217;m working with more registers, the library is now more efficient than previously. Not that that matters really for these calls, but it&#8217;s nice not to use as much stack.</p>

        <p>All of which is to say&#8230; yay! I think I have finally got to the bottom of how the OSLib interface definitions work, and the parser is mostly able to handle them (still doesn&#8217;t handle the comments so well&#8230; but there&#8217;s always scope for improvement), and hopefully OSLib will be useable in some real things soon. I built DrawFile with it a little while back, but it crashed badly, so maybe this&#8217;ll help.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s only taken me another 10 minutes or so to get the testing code working. It&#8217;s shown up loads of little differences that are really quite interesting to see. And probably really easy to fix.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Many of the *Memory tests show up differences in the case of the hex values that it is decoding (eg we use lower case &#8216;a0&#8217; rather than &#8216;A0&#8217;). Easy to fix.</li>
        	<li>The textual representation avoids using top-bit-set characters, displaying them as &#8216;.&#8217; instead of the character. That&#8217;s not a huge problem, and is an easy fix as well.</li>
        	<li>The *MemoryI outputs the hex representation and the textual representation in the opposite order to my other Debugger, which makes everything different.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So at the end of the run we have&#8230;</p>
        <pre>
        Pass:       0
        Fail:      29
        Crash:      0
        Skip:      23
        </pre>
        <p>which isn&#8217;t ideal but almost all of those differences are resolvable.<br />
        I&#8217;ll not commit the code, but leave it until next week and we can investigate the test results and fix what&#8217;s needed.</p>]]>

      <title>Screen grab websites with Webshot from Kevin Wells</title>
      <link>https://www.riscository.com/2025/screen-grab-websites-webshot/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Kevin Wells has released a new application, called Webshot, which aims to take screen grabs of web pages. However, what it doesn&#8217;t do is simply save the screen (or browser window), which you could achieve anyway using Paint&#8217;s snapshot facility, or a third party application such as Snapper. Instead, you give it the address of the page you want a snapshot of, and using Wget, Webshot sends that information off to the application programmer interface of a website called Screenshot API, and what the site feeds back is an image&#8230;]]>

        <![CDATA[The next friendly fireside chat for people interested in RISC OS software development will take place at 7:30pm on Saturday, 9th August. Taking place online via the Zoom video conferencing service, these meetings are intended as an informal way of allowing RISC OS programmers, and anyone interested in the subject, to get together online to discuss relevant matters. With no specific topic planned, discussions are steered by what people bring up, so that could be their current works-in-progress, development of RISC OS itself, the tools available, and so on –&#8230;]]>

      <source:markdown>The period between stable releases is the perfect time to try out some experimental changes to RISC OS. If you’ve bought one of the top-of-the-range [Raspberry Pi 4’s](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) with 4GB or 8GB of RAM the good news is that that extra memory can now be unlocked by dropping the [Beta RPi ROM (8GB Support)](/zipfiles/platform/raspberry-pi/BCM2835Dev-8GB.5.31.zip) onto your SD card.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Kevin Wells has found another remote application programmer interface (API) to make use of for the benefit of RISC OS users, and as a result has released a new application: Web2PDF. Like a lot of Kevin&#8217;s software, Web2PDF makes use of Wget to relay information input into the program&#8217;s RISC OS window to the remote API, and then feed the results back to the user. Usually those results are presented to the user via the application itself, but this time there is a subtle difference. The remote API used by&#8230;]]>

        <![CDATA[Some time back, Karl Clark released ArcMouse, an interface that could be plugged in to the mouse port on Archimedes-era ARM-based computers from Acorn and allowed a more standard USB mouse to be used. Karl has now improved on the design, and has launched ArcMouse version 2. The new design is that at just 12mm wide, it&#8217;s notably smaller than the older version, which makes it more compatible with the &#8216;all in one&#8217; style of RISC OS computer from Acorn (such as the A3000, on which the mouse port is&#8230;]]>

The company today announced the launch of its Moonshots programme &#8211; a strategic shift away from incremental development, towards large-scale engineering efforts aimed at modernising the operating system for next-generation Arm architectures.</p>

        <p><span class="caps">RISC</span> OS, originally developed alongside the first Arm chips in Cambridge, remains a uniquely simple and efficient desktop operating system.

      <source:markdown>Cambridge, UK – 28-Mar-2025 – RISC OS Open Limited (ROOL) is calling on the global technology community to support a bold new initiative to secure the long-term future of RISC OS. The company today announced the launch of its Moonshots programme – a strategic shift away from incremental development, towards large-scale engineering efforts aimed at modernising the operating system for next-generation Arm architectures.

However, the platform now faces an existential challenge.</source:markdown>
