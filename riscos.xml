        <![CDATA[I've been working on Ovation Pro to add extra scaling options to the picture proxy setting. For those who attended my @rougol.bsky.social talk, I explained the use of proxy images. Base/16, Base/32 & Base/64 now offer even smaller proxies, making for smaller document sizes.

        <![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had the wheels off IPPTrnspt for a few weeks now, but I&#8217;ve got it to the point where it will print (a single side, anyway!) to an Epson XP-8700 and an HP Envy 6010.  The HP closes the network handle after every <span class="caps">HTTP</span> transaction, so the old code was never going to drive it.</p>
        <p>So, positive progress, but there&#8217;s more testing to be done (and, I&#8217;m sure, more errors and deficiencies to correct) before I release a new version.</p>
        <p>The HP printer was given to me by a neighbour when he couldn&#8217;t get it to work after changing internet service provider.  He&#8217;d already bought a new one before I knew, otherwise I could have saved him the expense.  Anyway&#8230; he had an Instant Ink subscription, which he quite rightly cancelled when he gave me the printer.  Within a few days, the printer was refusing to print, giving error E0.  That&#8217;s because the cartridges were no longer covered by a subscription, so HP disabled them.  <span class="caps">AFAIAA</span> it is not possible under any circumstances to recover them.  What a waste.</p>]]>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Can&#8217;t say why it hangs the OS &#8211; that seems somewhat broken to me &#8211; but the error is almost certainly because the tool does not create the leading directories. Do that manually, and all will work. Or look at the OSLib sources for the register details, as these are much easier to read.</p>]]>

      <title>Live Coding with Gerph, Sunday 28th September at 1pm.</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/20035</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Hiya,</p>
        <p>This Sunday – 28th September, at 1pm – I&#8217;m doing the live coding again, continuing with the SystemVars module.</p>
        <p>Come along if you like – <a href="https://youtube.com/live/yqhMFMEuIcU?feature=share">https://youtube.com/live/yqhMFMEuIcU?feature=share</a><br />
         – or you can always watch the video afterwards at the same address.</p>
        <p>This week, I&#8217;ll be looking at extending the system variable types from just plain text. Hopefully, I&#8217;ll manage to get the macro variables implemented, at least.</p>
        <hr />
        <p>For anyone who hasn&#8217;t seen these live coding sessions, this where I share my screen for about 3 hours and code some <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS component, whilst talking about what I&#8217;m doing, what I&#8217;m thinking, and answering questions on the chat.</p>
        <p>So far, the implementation has:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> implementations in the module (as regular SWIs)</li>
        	<li>Reading string variables through a <span class="caps">SWI</span>.</li>
        	<li>Writing string variables through a <span class="caps">SWI</span>.</li>
        	<li>Rudimentary tests of the read/write process.</li>
        	<li>Automatic builds and releases through the CI on GitHub.</li>
        	<li>The module can be built and runs on 32-bit <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <p>If you want to watch the whole series, you can follow it through the playlist on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLWrBmpvj5s&amp;list=PLVVIu906Y7rErDqQiC48sWdsrD-AeQ8wS">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLWrBmpvj5s&amp;amp;list=P…</a></p>

        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>Also very keen to see how your Merlin project is progressing which although I will not be at the London Show (bit of a journey) hope to see some photos / videos / writeup about current state when you demonstrate it</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Thanks so much for your interest on Merlin, and sorry to hear you won&#8217;t be able to make it at the London Show. I&#8217;ll try to share something, but I really appreciate people coming by and have a chat, in the end I am making all this for the fun.</p>
        <p>Anyway, here’s a quick status update: Merlin successfully loads, maps, and initializes some of the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 5 <span class="caps">ROM</span> modules on AArch32. This is a big step, as AArch32 is fundamental for testing the mechanisms needed to load and run older modules. At the current pace, it will still take some years before Merlin is ready for general user testing, but it’s steadily moving forward. Encouragingly, I’ve also found a couple of US companies interested in supporting Merlin’s development. Their focus isn’t on the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS side specifically, but even partial support helps ensure the project keeps progressing toward completion.</p>
        <p>That said, the most exciting thing to see at the London Show will probably be the progresses on my Ultima VM. It demonstrates that we can build powerful interpreters on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS, offering:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>performance far beyond <span class="caps">BBC</span> <span class="caps">BASIC</span> (on all platforms)</li>
        	<li>a strong security model and full memory protection</li>
        	<li>native preemptive multitasking for apps, fully integrated with the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS <span class="caps">WIMP</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This last point is especially exciting: developers will finally be able to write programs without worrying about the cooperative scheduler, just like on Linux, Windows, or macOS. Apps already run smoothly, multitasking seamlessly, and Ultima handles all messaging for an application. It’s also outperforming Python and Lua on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS.</p>
        <p>Best of all, apps written for Ultima not only run safely (no OS crashes when things go wrong), but also run unchanged across Linux, macOS, Windows, <span class="caps">BSD</span>, and on multiple architectures including <span class="caps">ARM</span>, x86, and <span class="caps">RISC</span>-V.</p>
        <p>So while Merlin is steadily evolving, I think Ultima VM is where things get truly exciting right now; it’s going to make coding on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS much easier, way faster and more enjoyable for everyone.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>I can understand the attraction of using pCloud directly from <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. But failing that, if you have a <span class="caps">NAS</span>, it may be poossible to get the <span class="caps">NAS</span> to connect to pCloud, and then use LanMan98 or <span class="caps">NFS</span> to access it from <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS until CloudFS is revived.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I actually use this approach anyway now. The reality is this approach also boost performance. I let my Linux box do the sync up in the background, while local share is ultra fast like this and has another advantage, as soon as my ShareFS for Linux is completed and working, I&#8217;ll &#8220;re-share&#8221; my pCloud via ShareFS Server, which means pCLoud for old <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 3 on the Archie as well! ;)</p>
        <p>So the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS pCloud client is useful only to who has not a 3rd party Linux box in their network.</p>
        <p>Just my 0.5c.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I’ve taken a couple of embedded projects from ARM32 to AArch64. The biggest time sinks weren’t the compiler, but hidden 32-bit assumptions: pointer math in ints, varargs, packed structs, and unions. Rewriting inline asm and aligning to the AAPCS64 calling convention was unavoidable. What helped most was harsh warnings, UBSan/ASan in tests, and swapping types to size_t/uintptr_t early. For legacy apps we used a small thunk layer and kept a 32-bit build running until parity.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[This is 100% insane. Yes, an employer may stipulate this in your employment contract, but that's because *they* are paying *you* for your time, and so the things you create during your working hours are their IP. The tenant/landlord relationship is in no way comparable!

        The audio samples total 50K ( Bytes )
        The SPC-700 music driver is 8K
        Each level tune is between 2K and 4K
        The sound effects use 4K.
        
        Amazing!]]>

        <![CDATA[So much I agree with here. Games are meant to be enjoyable, and all the more so when you can share your experiences of them with others. Easy mode is my default for new games as it helps me get a feel for them and - sometimes! - even complete them. Difficulty is there for replay only, in my world.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Live coding today was another success&#8230;</p>
        <p>There&#8217;s now a Git repository on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-systemvars">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-systemvars</a>) stub module for SystemVars, which allows simple strings to be stored in a dictionary and retrieved. There are some simple SWIs implemented that allow the interface to be exercised. The module also has CI to ensure that the build and loading of the module is successful &#8211; and there&#8217;s a small test to exercise the internals.</p>
        <p>As usual, if anyone has any questions, comments or even code suggestions and PRs, please fire them this way.</p>]]>

      <title>RISC OS 64bit work status</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/13/topics/20027</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Quick status update on the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 progress, since I posted last&#8230;</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The links on the repository have been updated with pages for individual modules, listing the features that those modules need to have and their current status.</li>
        	<li>I&#8217;m happy with my implementation of the Debugger module now, and the live coding for that has finished. It&#8217;s not quite as functional as the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac version / the riscos-disassemble Python package, but it&#8217;s working ok for me.</li>
        	<li>New `Conversions` module implementation which works.</li>
        	<li>Most of the `Convert*` modules have now been built, though not tested in 64bit (they&#8217;re not really important at this stage, but it&#8217;s good to know they build!</li>
        	<li>The `IconBorders` modules all build just fine.</li>
        	<li>Problems I had with `RemotePrinterSupport` have now been fixed and it builds in 64bit.</li>
        	<li>`ResourceFS` stub module is now complete, and obviously doesn&#8217;t do much yet.</li>
        	<li>`VideoTTX`, `VideoGuard` and `MimeMap` built for 64bit, although they&#8217;re not tested and probably won&#8217;t quite do what&#8217;s expected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And internally I&#8217;ve been updating my build environment to better handle certain cases that weren&#8217;t working previously.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>The <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Build service now has the ability to enable faster builds, using the host version of the tools &#8211; see <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/741270">https://asciinema.org/a/741270</a> for a simple run.</li>
        	<li>Improved integration within the SublimeText editor &#8211; pressing command-B can now build things with <span class="caps">AMU</span> locally and highlight the errors inline in the file, or with the build service.</li>
        	<li>Improvements to CMunge for 64bit interfaces that weren&#8217;t quite right, and the -zerrors switch, that I had recently broken.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The most recent test run says that most of the modules and tools that are present in the repository at least load correctly:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/actions/runs/17814204760">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/actions/runs/…</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The progress for Phase 1 is looking pretty good now, with many components exceeding the original aims for this phase. Still 17 falling short, but they&#8217;re probably going to be reletively easy to get to an appropriate state.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Progress">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/wiki/Progress</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>And the SystemVars module is one of those modules that I will be moving on to in the Live Coding sessions. I suspect this will be relatively easy to deal with, but there will almost certainly be some special cases to handle.</p>
        <p>Anyhow that&#8217;s where things are for me. You can always follow the repositories to see what&#8217;s being done.</p>
        <p>Again, if anyone wants to contribute to these, please speak up.</p>]]>

      <title>Developers’ fireside chat – 20th September</title>
      <link>https://www.riscository.com/2025/developers-fireside-chat-20th-september/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The next friendly fireside chat for people interested in RISC OS software development will take place at 7:30pm on Saturday, 20th September. Taking place online via the Zoom video conferencing service, these meetings are intended as an informal way of allowing RISC OS programmers, and anyone interested in the subject, to get together online to discuss relevant matters. These meetings don&#8217;t have a set agenda, and topics discussed are based on the questions people might ask or what they&#8217;ve been working on and choose to demonstrate. For example, topics covered&#8230;]]>

      <title>Stations more accessible in TrainTimes 2.07</title>
      <link>https://www.riscository.com/2025/traintimes-2-07/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[A new version of TrainTimes has been released. The program is one from the Kevin Wells family of applications that use Wget to request data from a remote application programmer interface (API). In this case, the program can be used to check train timetables, as well as find out useful information about the trains themselves, the stations along their route, and so on. It does so through two different APIs &#8211; Real Train Times (from whom, users will need to register for an API key) and National Rail. The update&#8230;]]>

      <title>Debugger module release</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/20025</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Over the course of the last 19 live coding sessions, I have produced a Debugger module which supports many of the things that we expect on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. We support&#8230;</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><code>*Memory</code></li>
        	<li><code>*MemoryI</code></li>
        	<li><code>*MemoryA</code></li>
        	<li><code>*DumpI</code></li>
        	<li><code>*InitStore</code></li>
        	<li><code>*ShowRegs</code></li>
        	<li><code>*BreakSet</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*BreakClr</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*BreakList</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*Debug</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><code>*Continue</code> (not for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_Disassemble</code></li>
        	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_DisassembleThumb</code></li>
        	<li><span class="caps">SWI</span> <code>Debugger_DisassembleArch</code> (for AArch32 <span class="caps">ARM</span> and Thumb, and for AArch64 instructions)</li>
        	<li>AArch32 instructions are disassembled (default for regular <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS), including the <span class="caps">FPA</span> instructions.</li>
        	<li>AArch64 instructions are disassembled (default for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64)</li>
        	<li>The module is built and released automatically through CI on GitHub – <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases</a></li>
        	<li>There’s a project board to record what needs to be done – <a href="https://github.com/users/gerph/projects/1">https://github.com/users/gerph/projects/1</a></li>
        	<li>The module can be built, and runs on both 32-bit and 64-bit <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS.</li>
        	<li>The module is tested with test code derived from the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac test suites &#8211; automatically within CI.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The module has been demonstrated and run on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS in RPCEmu with !Zap and works as you might expect.</p>
        <p>The module can be obtained from the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Debugger GitHub site &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c/releases</a></p>
        <hr />
        <p>The purpose of the Live Coding sessions was &#8211; initially &#8211; so that I could get some practice at doing coding in a different environment, and demonstrating how some techniques and skills can be used. I was hoping that it would be an encouragement to others that things which seem complicated are largely just a set of small steps to address a problem.</p>
        <p>The Debugger module was intended to be a &#8216;simple&#8217; example of how porting something useful to <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS can be done. It wasn&#8217;t quite so simple &#8211; there&#8217;s been work in shell, in python, in perl, and assembler and converting from C99 to C89. And working with someone else&#8217;s code which I didn&#8217;t understand at first. I hope that it has given people some encouragement to try doing things they wouldn&#8217;t have. I hope that it has also shown that mistakes are many and plentiful &#8211; and we roll with them. It&#8217;s also shown how bad my typing is!</p>
        <p>It&#8217;s been very exciting. I&#8217;ve laughed a lot. And along the way there&#8217;s been a number of people coming into the chat and watching the sessions without knowing anything about <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. People who asked questions &#8211; even if they&#8217;re not on the topic of the debugger &#8211; and have been very friendly. That&#8217;s been a nice experience too.</p>
        <p>So it&#8217;s been quite successful, and has produced a replacement module in C for an existing module. Feel free to raise bugs in GitHub, and PRs will be happily received if they&#8217;re incremental and reviewable.</p>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This was the final session on the Debugger. I&#8217;m pretty happy with the disassembler now. This final session updated the CI tests so that they (mostly) pass. There were some failures when it was finally integrated into the CI, which I decided to fix offline &#8211; they were caused by the use of a non-deterministic part of the table generation in Python. Now that it&#8217;s fixed, I think we&#8217;ve got a good version.</p>
        <p>The Debugger has been published up on the site in the releases section: <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c">https://github.com/gerph/riscos-debugger-c</a></p>
        <p>The 64bit version can be found on the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64bit status pages: <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status</a></p>

        <p>Next week, I&#8217;ll be starting on a different project &#8211; something short, I hope!</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>There is always a different way of doing things. I embarked on a project to produce a series of signal box registers in 2007 and have, so far, completed Volumes 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9, with Volumes 2, 5A, 5B and 5C still to do. I started off using an <span class="caps">HTML</span> master to produce the <span class="caps">PDF</span> (not a good choice) and ended up creating a Draw file for each individual page. ArtWorks was used to create the cover <span class="caps">PDF</span> using <span class="caps">CMYK</span> colours and the Postscript level 3 drivers and ps2pdf to convert the Draw files to a <span class="caps">PDF</span> for each page.</p>
        <p>I wrote it up but noone has yet decided to publish it so <a href="https://www.svrsig.org/Proj5_A4.pdf">here it is</a></p>]]>

        <p>Harrow District Masonic Centre<br />

Between them they provide direct links to almost all the main London terminal stations.</p>
        <p>Tickets are 7 pounds on the door, with under-16s free. Please bring the correct change if possible (or say &#8220;Keep the change&#8221;!), or we can accept card payment.</p>
        <p>We will have the usual varied mix of stands with all the latest software and hardware, plus a separate theatre for presentations. There will be the latest machines from R-Comp and RISCOSbits, all the parts you need from <span class="caps">CJE</span> Micros, updated applications from SineNomine and Dynabyte, OS updates from <span class="caps">ROD</span> and <span class="caps">ROOL</span>, and games from <span class="caps">AMCOG</span> and SoftRock.</p>
        <p>Keep an eye on the show website for the latest news &#8211; <a href="https://www.riscoslondonshow.co.uk/">https://www.riscoslondonshow.co.uk/</a></p>
        <p>For those planning to stay overnight, in addition to the local Premier Inn there are many cheaper hotels in Watford. These are good options because Watford is just outside the <span class="caps">ULEZ</span> area and only a 25 minute drive away, plus Watford Junction and Watford High Street stations are on the London Overground line with direct trains to Kenton every 15 minutes taking 20 minutes. Why not make a long weekend of it and visit some of London&#8217;s many attractions while you&#8217;re here, taking advantage of the excellent public transport links into the heart of the city.</p>
        <p>This is your opportunity to chat with developers and fellow enthusiasts, hear the latest news, catch up with old friends, and maybe make some new ones. Look forward to seeing lots of you there :-)</p>
        <p>Bryan.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[This is an excellent opportunity to explore professional desktop publishing on RISC OS at no cost, guided by someone with years of experience. RISC OS is open-source and can run natively on the Raspberry Pi 4, Pi 400, and earlier models.

        <![CDATA[<p>I suppose I should reply to this thread</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>My view is that if there is any wider future for “RISC OS”, it’s applying the look and feel to the 64 bit OS and applications that I and millions of others are using on Linux.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A lot of what you desire already exists, or at least a runnable foundation does.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHsHU-dDwAk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHsHU-dDwAk</a></p>
        <p>Source code here;<br />
        <a href="https://home.marutan.net/hg/riscwm">https://home.marutan.net/hg/riscwm</a></p>
        <p>Here are a few pros and cons compared;</p>
        <p>Pros</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Already runs on 64bit (arm, x64, powerpc, whatever)</li>
        	<li>Runs Linux <sup id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> apps (technically more easily than <span class="caps">ROLF</span>, as it doesn&#8217;t require apps to be recompiled/linked against a different graphics stack).</li>
        	<li>Runs <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS apps, via RPCEmu</li>
        	<li>Contributing programmers don&#8217;t need to be able to program an OS, this is an application written in (comparatively) high-level C.</li>
        	<li>Large chunks of contributions do not require programming at all, it is often theme and config file tweaking.</li>
        	<li>Small enough in scope to not take person-decades of effort.</li>
        	<li>Does not require anyone to pay for tools to contribute.</li>
        	<li>Not asking for 2.5 million.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cons</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>It&#8217;ll never be able to exactly make all Linux apps look and behave like <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS ones, you can theme, tweak widget libraries, but it will never be 100% perfect.</li>
        	<li>It&#8217;s far too easy to look at the project and go &#8220;but that&#8217;s not <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS&#8221; and ignore it completely.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Is it finished? Nope, but if this is something you actually want to move forward with you should certainly give it a go and see if it&#8217;s the start you wanted.</p>
        <p>Realistically I do not worry about the &#8216;future of <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS&#8217;, there are not enough people left, and everyone has a different idea of what it is. But if you do worry about such things, I would suggest working out how to contribute to your dreams, as we are way past just sitting on the sidelines and hoping the future falls into your lap.</p>
        <p><sup id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Technically it is not hard-linked to Linux, you could run it on top of one of the BSDs, Solaris, etc, something with XWindows on</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I can see that makes sense&#8230; the snag is the lack of an equivalent of the &#8216;welcome guide&#8217;. Even the maker&#8217;s webpages don&#8217;t help much and even use different icons to what I see on a new machine! It&#8217;s assumed the owner &#8216;just knows&#8217;.</p>
        <p>Yes, I did know that Android has avery different interface because it is used on systems quite unlike a standard desktop machine. But the lack of ad init info has been the problem. Taken me ages to get even the basic functions sorted.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[The next meeting of the RISC OS User Group of London (ROUGOL) will take place on Monday, 15th September, with Gavin Crawford taking the podium to talk about how he uses Ovation Pro in his publishing business. A graphic artist and designer with over forty years experience in the field of printing and publishing, Gavin started out at his family&#8217;s printing company in the mid-1980s, at which time artwork was hand-drawn. He introduced BBC Micros for admin tasks, later to be replaced by RISC OS machines, and by the mid-1990s&#8230;]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Hi all<br />
        Many moons ago (21 years, actually), I uploaded a bunch of stuff to <a href="http://www.lewisgilbert.co.uk">http://www.lewisgilbert.co.uk</a>. Having left it there, unloved and abandoned for a while, I&#8217;ve now put it on my current site <a href="https://www.inglenot.com/archiology/">Inglenot</a> <br />
        The other site will die soon, so if anyone is still interested or linked to it, please check out the new site.<br />
        Also, if anyone can update the credits &#8211; comp.sys.acorn.networking is still given in the original &#8211; I&#8217;d be grateful<br />
        Cheers<br />

        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>-marm is the standard gcc flag for compiling the binary as ARM32 (as opposed to thumb, or whatever the toolchain is set to). The binary can be whatever – what the <span class="caps">JIT</span> generates doesn’t need to match.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It doesn&#8217;t change anything, and this statement is technically true (it would be trivial to support arm32 binary with Thumb2 <span class="caps">JIT</span>, and vice versa, if you had both JITs available), but it turns out WebKit didn&#8217;t have shims between Thumb and traditional so the -marm or -mthumb2 flag would have actually toggled both the binary and the <span class="caps">JIT</span> (pre-2018). I think that explains the confusion about using -marm to use the ARM32 <span class="caps">JIT</span>.</p>
        <p>That&#8217;s possibly the reason the preferred <span class="caps">JIT</span> is Thumb (as the binary would have been Thumb), though another could be because condition flags seem barely used in the generated code, meaning it&#8217;s a waste of memory (space and bandwidth) (4 bits per 32-bit instruction wasted, so may as well use 16bit thumb). I imagine they&#8217;re barely used because it&#8217;s a very simple optimiser which works on all supported CPUs (at the time: SH4/<span class="caps">MIPS</span>/ARM32/AArch64/x86).</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Yes. Feel free to try it &#8211; it&#8217;s in the riscos64-status repository.</p>
        <p>The CI hasn&#8217;t built it properly since I started introducing the tests, but I try to put a version in that repository after it has been updated. <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/tree/master/rm32">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/tree/master/r…</a> has the 32bit <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS version.</p>
        <p>The 64bit version also works too &#8211; you can load that into the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 shell and see it working&#8230;</p>
        <p>Go to: <a href="https://shell.riscos.online/static/term64.html">https://shell.riscos.online/static/term64.html</a></p>
        <p>Then:</p>
        <pre>
        *URLCopy <a href="https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/raw/refs/heads/master/rm64/Debugger,ffa">https://github.com/gerph/riscos64-status/raw/refs/head…</a> Debugger
        *SetType Debugger Module
        *RMLoad Debugger
        </pre>
        <p>and you can use it as you might expect &#8211; as stated breakpoint handling is not defined yet for 64bit.</p>
        <p>The demonstration in RPCEmu in episode 11 starts at 2:39:54 so you can see the module being used inside !Zap.</p>
        <p>Around here is where I&#8217;m loading up RPCEmu to test the module:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/sb2PBL2QmVA?si=_ezJA1CaClZjbPgW&amp;t=9594">https://www.youtube.com/live/sb2PBL2QmVA?si=_ezJA1CaCl…</a></p>
        <p>The module is tested on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac, and I&#8217;ve demonstrated it on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 4. I assume it works on <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 5 &#8211; other than the breakpoint handling it&#8217;s not doing anything special, and nobody&#8217;s reported any issues. Then again, nobody&#8217;s actually said they tried it so&#8230; meh&#8230;</p>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>I have a Raspberry Pi 4 and I build a game I wrote, about 40,000 lines of C.<br />
        Building from the SD card takes over 10 minutes, without timing it, building from <span class="caps">RAM</span> disk takes maybe a minute.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Something there doesn&#8217;t quite sound right to me.</p>
        <p>Taking <a href="https://gitlab.riscosopen.org/RiscOS/Sources/HWSupport/USB/Controllers/DWCDriver">DWCDriver</a> as an example of a thing which is ~36000 lines of C, I compiled that on a Pi 2 which has a no-name micro SD card from the supermarket and on 3 runs I get</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>24s</li>
        	<li>24s</li>
        	<li>25s</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Those 36000 lines result in 19 object files being written to the card, and looking at the dependencies which are written to the Makefile there are 591 lines, which I interpret as meaning 591 files were <strong>read</strong> in order to <strong>write</strong> 19 object files.</p>
        <p>If anything the times would reduce (if bound by processing speed alone, using the same SD card) as a Pi 4 is faster than a Pi 2, so I wonder how the 40000 lines of the game can take 20x longer to build?</p>]]>

      <title>RDPclient with Windows 10</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/11/topics/20005</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>It would be nice to hear from somebody who can say:<br />
        <em>“Yes, I am using !RDPclient on Windows 10 Pro 24H2 and this is what I did.”</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Mine is Windows 10 Pro, Version	22H2 (the latest), OS Build 19045.6216 and I can&#8217;t for the life of me work out why it works for me and not for you. It&#8217;ll be one mystical incantation somewhere that&#8217;s been forgotten by time (or, as Steve suggests, overridden in newer versions and updates). That said, I have it working on Windows 11 &#8211; for now, at least.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The OpenSSL code compiled into RDPClient is dated 2004, recompiling to use the current code is the way to go. Probably utilising the AcornSSL module as a more future-proof system-wide <span class="caps">SSL</span>/<span class="caps">TLS</span> support.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I&#8217;d love to see this happen, but I know where people have tried to build just the existing source, it doesn&#8217;t work well. Andrew Sellors did pop up at one point and in a brief conversation he said he might look at updating to the latest codebase, but I think he&#8217;s long gone from the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS world now.</p>
        <p>For anyone who&#8217;s used RDPClient, going back to <span class="caps">VNC</span> is painfully slow and clunky, and ultimately much poorer experience.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[We had a VIC 20 at school and I used it a few times, but preferred using the CBM PET. I wanted to know more about the hardware so bought the official Programmer's Reference Manual ( 1982 ). It's a great book that covers the machine really well - it even has a fold-out system schematic. #Commodore]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<blockquote>
        <p>thanks for the list of resources and creating a lot of those by yourself as well – this is impressive.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>My pleasure and I am sure also the guys who helped and <span class="caps">ROOL</span> will be happy to hear all the resources were useful :)</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>there are some toolchains allowing for a great cross-debugging experience (also on-target, I used them for Cortex-M variants) that would streamline the process of doing that adaption moonshot needs.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Indeed. I am rewriting my own <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS using Rust and I have already reached the stage where I can have live source debugging of the entire kernel and even in tools like VSCode, so in my case (and I am talking about my case only) I don&#8217;t have any limitation coming from <span class="caps">DDE</span> being old limited. But <span class="caps">ROOL</span> is a different beast and I am not associated with them in any form or shape, so no idea what they are planning and how. But I know at least a few of them work in embedded development, so I know they are aware of the modern tools available.</p>
        <p>Here is a picture for you:<br />
        <img src="https://paolozaino.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-3.png" width="480" /></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>as far as I know, the <span class="caps">SWI</span> interfacing into module code by using some of the <span class="caps">ARM</span> registers and bank-switching others should translate into a function call in C like it did back in the days with 24bit code, but I assume subtle differences might need addressing (and to overcome) depending on the <span class="caps">ARM</span> core used and depending on the linker.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It&#8217;s already possible to write modules in C and by long time, moreover with the transition to AArch64, they will probably need to embrace an interface like CallASWI which somewhat resemble the mechanism in modern OS used to call proper SysCalls; so I think <span class="caps">ROOL</span> have already addressed this. Given CallASWI is also a mechanism recommended to use on 32bit, it maybe a functional way to make both <span class="caps">ABI</span> and <span class="caps">API</span> feels close and somewhat standardised. But again, I am guessing here, <span class="caps">ROOL</span> is the entity with the details.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>would a simulation of a minimal machine as a ‘proof of concept’ and/or starting point would make sense before switching to real hardware, or does this exist already either intendedly or as an existing product like in the riscos on linux approach?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Not sure what you mean here, sorry. As for my work I debug my own <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS (Merlin) using <span class="caps">QEMU</span> (as well as real Raspberry Pis), so I use <span class="caps">QEMU</span> as the simulation for both 32 and 64 bit . It&#8217;s not perfect, but it does a relatively good job.</p>
        <p>If I was in charge (and I am not), I&#8217;d recommend to use <span class="caps">GCC</span> and make sure to produce a symbol file so that future <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS can be debugged live and source level using <span class="caps">QEMU</span> and the embedded <span class="caps">GDB</span> server, makes everyone&#8217;s life easier (a looooot easier), and allow also less skilled developers to be able to help.</p>
        <p>But people are entitled to their own opinions, so I guess <span class="caps">ROOL</span> at some point will start answering these questions, they are probably catching up with the technical requirements people are posting about here and there.</p>
        <p>Anyway if you&#8217;d like to start a specific topic about the 64bit work please feel free to use the dedicated section of the forum:</p>

        <p>Ah, I didn&#8217;t interpret that in that way, then I read the example which I took to mean <code>Image.A.1</code> was being deleted using the Filer yet somehow the UpCall for <code>Image.A.1</code> wasn&#8217;t happening.</p>
        <p>Sounds like the image filing system has a &#8220;real&#8221; file <code>Image.A.1</code> then a virtual/symlink type of setup where you want &#8220;fake&#8221; file <code>Image.Mirage.NotReal.A.1</code> to also vanish from the Filer view. All makes sense now!</p>]]>

      <title>Time for a Qemu port</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/9/topics/18863</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The whole porting of RiscOS was started by Jeffrey Lee back in the day when the first BeagleBoard came to life and the raspberry pi did not yet exist. <br />
        I responded to a post from Jeffrey when he got stuck with Qemu and needed real hardware that was difficult to come by at the time. <br />
        As I had the same idea some weeks earlier, I already had a BeagleBoard available and so Jeffrey, being as fast as he was, flooded me with new progress often daily so that I had enough to do with getting the stuff onto the board and reporting on what worked and what didn&#8217;t. (Initially I wanted to code as well, but did not want to slow down Jeffrey progress so kept to the role of tester).<br />
        So there was some Qemu code written by Jeffrey, but the code never reached the command line prompt afaik.</p>]]>

For example a port can provide hardware <span class="caps">RTS</span>/<span class="caps">CTS</span> control so bit 3 should be set irrespectively of how it is configured.</p>]]>

      <title>Live Coding with Gerph, Sunday 31st August at 1pm</title>
      <link>https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/forums/1/topics/19999</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Live coding today was quite successful, albeit I spent a lot of time fumbling around tweaking bits to <code>*Memory</code> working right &#8211; which, if I&#8217;d thought a bit more, would have been easier.</p>
        <p>Anyhow, comparing against the <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Pyromaniac test results, there were a number of changes to tidy the output up and make it more consistent. The results are pretty good. Of the tests we now have a bunch of passes&#8230;</p>
        <pre>
        -----------
        Pass:      20
        Fail:      15
        Crash:      0
        Skip:      36
        -----------
        Total run:       35
        Pass ratio:   57.14 %
        Fail ratio:   42.86 %
        </pre>
        <p>Which means that we&#8217;re quite consistent. These aren&#8217;t automated into the CI yet, so next week, hopefully we can fix a number of them and then automate them to CI.</p>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Hiya,</p>
        <p>Quick update on the progress with OSLib&#8230; I&#8217;ve mentioned before the work that I&#8217;ve done towards creating the OSLib veneers for <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS 64 (and using them for other purposes). These are now complete, I believe &#8211; all the interfaces for OSLib should now be converted properly.</p>
        <p>Previously, I&#8217;d not implemented the non- X-variants of the SWIs, and those calls that spilled arguments on to the caller stack were not generated properly. These issues have both now been fixed &#8211; I realised what the &#8216;!&#8217; means on the def file exit parameters, and these are now set up properly. Together with remembering that I&#8217;m working with more registers, the library is now more efficient than previously. Not that that matters really for these calls, but it&#8217;s nice not to use as much stack.</p>

        <p>All of which is to say&#8230; yay! I think I have finally got to the bottom of how the OSLib interface definitions work, and the parser is mostly able to handle them (still doesn&#8217;t handle the comments so well&#8230; but there&#8217;s always scope for improvement), and hopefully OSLib will be useable in some real things soon. I built DrawFile with it a little while back, but it crashed badly, so maybe this&#8217;ll help.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s only taken me another 10 minutes or so to get the testing code working. It&#8217;s shown up loads of little differences that are really quite interesting to see. And probably really easy to fix.</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Many of the *Memory tests show up differences in the case of the hex values that it is decoding (eg we use lower case &#8216;a0&#8217; rather than &#8216;A0&#8217;). Easy to fix.</li>
        	<li>The textual representation avoids using top-bit-set characters, displaying them as &#8216;.&#8217; instead of the character. That&#8217;s not a huge problem, and is an easy fix as well.</li>
        	<li>The *MemoryI outputs the hex representation and the textual representation in the opposite order to my other Debugger, which makes everything different.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So at the end of the run we have&#8230;</p>
        <pre>
        Pass:       0
        Fail:      29
        Crash:      0
        Skip:      23
        </pre>
        <p>which isn&#8217;t ideal but almost all of those differences are resolvable.<br />
        I&#8217;ll not commit the code, but leave it until next week and we can investigate the test results and fix what&#8217;s needed.</p>]]>

His main focus will most decidedly NOT be on people who consider themselves to be elite, and how they network amongst themselves, and instead on how he has added network &#8211; specifically Econet &#8211; support to Elite, beginning&#8230;]]>

      <link>https://www.riscository.com/2025/screen-grab-websites-webshot/</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Kevin Wells has released a new application, called Webshot, which aims to take screen grabs of web pages. However, what it doesn&#8217;t do is simply save the screen (or browser window), which you could achieve anyway using Paint&#8217;s snapshot facility, or a third party application such as Snapper. Instead, you give it the address of the page you want a snapshot of, and using Wget, Webshot sends that information off to the application programmer interface of a website called Screenshot API, and what the site feeds back is an image&#8230;]]>

        <![CDATA[Good video from @davefarley77.bsky.social about vibe coding. I am extremely skeptical about vibe coding TBH, I cannot see an AI being able to produce code out of a "thin" spec, but even in the case it could, the nature of SWE and incrementalism will collide badly with the way current GenAI works.

What you usually won&#8217;t know until much closer to each meeting day, though, it&#8217;s what the meeting subject will be. Well, for&#8230;]]>

They "miscalculated" my father's investments for years; tried to fob him off with a box of wine before a lengthy battle resulted in an £8K settlement; sent him a "wealth report" without numbers, withholding how much money he had for 20 months.

Taking place online via the Zoom video conferencing service, these meetings are intended as an informal way of allowing RISC OS programmers, and anyone interested in the subject, to get together online to discuss relevant matters. With no specific topic planned, discussions are steered by what people bring up, so that could be their current works-in-progress, development of RISC OS itself, the tools available, and so on –&#8230;]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Cambridge, UK – 28-Mar-2025 – <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS Open Limited (<span class="caps">ROOL</span>) is calling on the global technology community to support a bold new initiative to secure the long-term future of <span class="caps">RISC</span> OS. The company today announced the launch of its Moonshots programme &#8211; a strategic shift away from incremental development, towards large-scale engineering efforts aimed at modernising the operating system for next-generation Arm architectures.</p>

        </div>
        <p><span class="caps">RISC</span> OS, originally developed alongside the first Arm chips in Cambridge, remains a uniquely simple and efficient desktop operating system. It has found renewed interest in recent years thanks to its availability on the Raspberry Pi and its open-source licensing model. However, the platform now faces an existential challenge.</p>]]>
