# Contributing to the LCROCC website

If you write a blog, micro-blog or podcast about RISC OS or machines running RISC OS you can submit your [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) link via a [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Left-Coast-RISC-OS-Computer-Club/left-coast-risc-os-computer-club.github.io). Please include the following information:

- the URL to your website
- the RSS link you'd like us to use
- a brief description of your site (a sentence or two is fine)

If we think it is a good match for our club site we'll add it to the list of feeds that show up on the [RISC OS around the web page](riscos.html).
